<p>Ok, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that the content on this blog has been rather nerd-heavy, somewhat breaking the promise I made when I first started it to have &ldquo;approximately the same mix of personal, political and technical content&rdquo; as my <a href="http://wlach.livejournal.com">old livejournal</a>. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to correct that for a while, but as often happens, other things have taken priority.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s time to make a stab at it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that a good numbers of searches on this blog have been for ginger tea and/or channa masala (chickpea curry). Must have something to do with this blog&rsquo;s name. Unsurprisingly, these hits tend to have a high bounce rate (people coming to the site and immediately leaving, probably dissatisfied). Well, it&rsquo;s about time these people get satisfaction with these wonderful, easy to follow recipes:</p>

<p><strong>Channa Masala</strong> (recipe courtesy of <a href="http://cloquewerk.livejournal.com">Mark C&ocirc;t&eacute;</a>)</p>

<p>1 medium-sized onion
 <br />1 clove garlic
 <br />1 2-cm cube ginger
 <br />2&ndash;3 fresh or dried chilis
 <br />1 tsp salt
 <br />1/2 tsp turmeric
 <br />1 small tomato
 <br />2&ndash;3 curry leaves
 <br />1 540 mL can chick peas
 <br />1 tsp garam masala</p>

<p>Saute onion, garlic, and chilis as usual, adding ginger at the same time as the garlic. Place the tomato in boiling water until you are easily able to remove the skin. Add salt, turmeric, tomato, and curry leaves, and cook for another minute. Add chick peas and cover with water. Cook for 15&ndash;20 minutes, until water is absorbed and chick peas are tender. Add garam masala, stir, and serve.</p>

<p><strong>Ginger Tea</strong> (very informal recipe)</p>

<p>1 hunk of ginger, coarsely chopped (perhaps 4 tablespoons worth)
 <br />4 tablespoons honey
 <br />3&ndash;4 cups water</p>

<p>Put above ingredients into pot, at maximum heat. Bring to boil. Turn heat to low, let cook for 30 minutes or so. Consume. It&rsquo;s the best medicine for a cold that i know.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2010/11/back-to-wordperfect-libwpd-0-9-0/">Back to WordPerfect: libwpd 0.9.0</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">Nov 17th, 2010</p>
    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Free-Software.html">Free Software</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>Those who&rsquo;ve known me for a while have probably heard about my first major open source project, <a href="http://libwpd.sourceforge.net">libwpd</a>. In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s a parser for WordPerfect documents with the primary aim of converting them into something usable by the major opensource office programs out there. It&rsquo;s used by <a href="http://libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, <a href="http://abisource.com">AbiWord</a>, and <a href="http://koffice.org">KOffice</a>. WordPerfect isn&rsquo;t the most popular word processor out there, but there&rsquo;s still quite a number of legacy documents in that format, especially in the legal community (which was almost exclusively using WordPerfect until very recently).</p>

<p>This project goes way back: I started work on it with Marc Maurer way back in 2002 (just after I graduated from University). I put a rather ridiculous amount of unpaid work into it for a few years. WordPerfect&rsquo;s streaming document format is a bit esoteric to say the least, and figuring out how to map into the document model used by more modern software was a pretty interesting problem. I still remember spending sleepless nights trying to reliably convert WordPerfect&rsquo;s outlining into structured lists (I mostly succeeded).</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve mostly moved on to other things, leaving the project in the capable hands of <a href="http://fridrich.blogspot.com">Fridrich Strba</a>, who&rsquo;s been steadily working on adding a number of important features to the library that massively improve import fidelity. I did have time this summer to add page numbering support (thanks to <a href="http://www.yamsoftware.com">Yam Software</a> for sponsoring that work) and move the project over to git from cvs, but for the most part it&rsquo;s been his show since late 2004.</p>

<p>Even if I&rsquo;m not as actively involved as I once was, when there&rsquo;s major developments, I still get excited (perhaps in the way that a parent might about a child who&rsquo;s left the household). And yesterday brought something pretty big: <a href="http://libwpd.sourceforge.net/news.html">libwpd 0.9.0</a>. With this release, we finally supports graphics (thanks to the work of Fridrich and Ariya Hidayat on <a href="http://libwpg.sourceforge.net">libwpg</a>), notes, the page numbering that I mentioned above, and support for encrypted documents. It&rsquo;s a big deal. Here&rsquo;s some before and after screenshots:</p>

    <br /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>All this goodness should be available transparently whenever you import a WordPerfect file in an upcoming release of <a href="http://libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>. AbiWord and KOffice filters should come soon enough as well (the updates needed to support libwpd 0.9 are fairly minimal).</p>

<p>Integration with OpenOffice.org is another story. Without going into great amount of detail on the situation (see <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/09/document-foundation-forks-openofficeorg-to-liberate-it-from-oracle.ars">this article</a> on Ars Technica for the gory details if you&rsquo;re really interested), it&rsquo;s quite unlikely that OpenOffice.org WordPerfect support will advance unless (1) someone volunteers to do it and (2) Oracle drops their copyright assignment policy. The chances of these things happening seem rather low to me. My personal recommendation would be to switch to <a href="http://libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> as soon as the first production version is released. I expect it to rapidly overtake OpenOffice.org in functionality due to its more open participation model.</p>

<p>Due to some schedule adjustments, it appears as if Metro Transit&rsquo;s Google Transit is <a href="http://www.halifax.ca/googletransit/">temporarily out of service</a> while they wait for Google to process their new transit feed.</p>

<p>However, fear not! Unlike Google, obsessive compulsive computer programmer William Lachance works on weekends for free (or the low, low price of $1.99 in the case of iPhone applications) so your thirst for updated transit information can be satisfied. I link to these things often enough on this blog, but here they are again, for the benefit of first time viewers:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://transittogo.mindsea.ca">Transit to Go</a>   In other news, it appears as if Metro Transit has finally seen the light and made their transit information available to anyone who wants it. I would like to think that I might have had <a href="http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/beta-the-public-transit-day-tripper/Content?oid=1098826">something to do with this</a>, but I honestly have no idea. Anyway, if you want to check it out, it&rsquo;s available <a href="http://www.halifax.ca/GoogleTransit/developerdata.html">here</a>.</li></ul>

<p>After a month long hiatus, I finally had a chance to get <a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a> back into a working state. The big difference is that we&rsquo;re now using the <a href="http://www.mindsea.com/2010/03/03/transit-to-go-pulling-out-all-the-stops/">official HRM transit data</a>. Lots more remains to be done to make this site competitive for 2010 (most of the recent work has been back-end infrastructure stuff), but at least it&rsquo;s usable again.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2010/04/oh-the-lines-and-some-help-for-edmonton/">yesterday&rsquo;s work</a> out of the way, there weren&rsquo;t too many extra steps required before I got a basic version of Transit to Go running for Edmonton. There are definitely bugs and rough edges (the bus names could definitely be better described/formatted, and there&rsquo;s some serious geocoder issues), but I think the heavy lifting is out of the way. I guess now would be a good time to open up an invitations to anyone in Edmonton with an iPhone to become part of our free private beta. We&rsquo;d love to hear what you think!

<p>A productive day on the transit development front. Finished up a few big features related to hbus.ca and Transit to Go:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Sped up the graph and database generation by an order of magnitude. Not too exciting from a user perspective, but I should now be able to iterate the codebase much faster.</li>
 <li>Better transit stop / street graph linking: No more does libroutez simply try to find the closest street level vertice to link to when merging transit stops with street information: we now actually create _new_ street level vertices as needed and link to those. Upshot? Slightly better directions and prettier polylines. When I first thought up the algorithm a month ago, I thought I was totally brilliant, only to later find out that Andrew Byrd had done something almost identical a few months earlier for <a href="http://github.com/andrewbyrd/graphserver">graphserver</a>. Ah well, at least it&rsquo;s implemented.</li>
 <li>I <a href="http://gist.github.com/361848">coded up a script</a> to automatically generate synthetic headsigns for GTFS feeds which don&rsquo;t have them. This was needed to provide a sensible view for the Edmonton version of Transit to Go. All the props in the world for opening up your data guys, but can&rsquo;t you do better than saying that all your buses go in the &ldquo;1&rdquo; direction? There&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s a required field you know. Not only would it help me, but <a href="http://google.com/transit">Google Transit</a> would give better results for your city as well.</li></ul>

<p>Because I don&rsquo;t have enough spare time projects (<em>this is a joke</em>), I decided to take on the task of adding a must-requested special iPhone/iPod-touch friendly view for the <a href="http://dev.wifidog.org/">WifiDog</a> authentication server (used by the infamous <a href="http://www.ilesansfil.org/">ÃŽle Sans Fil</a>) after being inspired by the WifiDog camp held a few weeks ago at Station C. I finally finally finished up a prototype today. It&rsquo;s a bit of a hack, but a relatively clean one: hopefully some version of it can be integrated into trunk, and users with mobile devices will have a better experience when they&rsquo;re on the go in Montr&eacute;al (or any other area with a community-oriented wifidog deployment: I hear there&rsquo;s lots).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling less and less enthusiastic about the iPhone lately, in particular after the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/376793/">ridiculous lawsuit against HTC</a>. It&rsquo;s no secret that we at <a href="http://navarra.ca">Navarra</a> have been doing quite a bit of work on that platform, as have my associates at <a href="http://mindsea.ca">Mindsea</a>. As long as there&rsquo;s demand from our clients, that won&rsquo;t change, but as an individual I&rsquo;m feeling less and less enthusiastic about supporting a company that (through its actions) demonstrates hostility to the ideals of autonomy and innovation that I hold dear. Now that an attractive alternative is available on reasonable terms, I&rsquo;m seriously considering switching horses in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;m overdue in announcing <a href="http://transittogo.mindsea.ca/">Transit to Go</a> a.k.a. &ldquo;the iPhone transit map that&rsquo;s demonstrably more useful than a paper schedule&rdquo; a.k.a. &ldquo;your bus departure in 15 seconds or less, no matter where you are&rdquo;. I wrote up a <a href="http://www.mindsea.com/blog/2010/03/transit-to-go-pulling-out-all-the-stops/">blog post</a> about it for <a href="http://www.mindsea.com">Mindsea</a>&#8216;s site, if you&rsquo;re interested in finding out more.</p>

<p>Second, all this transit excitement has made me start thinking about better routing and geometry algorithms again. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting a bit with Brandon Martin Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="http://github.com/bmander/prender">prender</a> framework, used by the infamous <a href="http://bmander.github.com/graphserver/">Graphserver</a>, and have been pretty happy with the results. It basically lets you do <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> visualizations in python (i.e. no Java coding required). Here&rsquo;s a quick picture of it in action, rendering the Nova Scotian road network, as distributed by <a href="http://geobase.ca">geobase</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2010/03/nova_scotia.png" alt="Nova Scotia as rendered by prender" title="Nova Scotia as rendered by prender" width="400" height="220" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" /></p>

<p>The neat thing about this framework is that you can render quickly to an arbitrary level of detail, which should prove very useful when troubleshooting the behavior of some of the code I&rsquo;m working on. If anyone is interested in running the framework on MacOS X (like I was), <a href="http://github.com/wlach/prender">my fork</a> of the project has the appropriate patches.</p>
