Just a quick note that I'll shortly be travelling from the frozen land of Montreal, Canada to Japan and Taiwan over the next week, with no particular agenda other than to explore and meet people. If any Mozillians are interested in meeting up for food or drink, and discussion of [FirefoxOS performance][1], [Eideticker][2], [entropy][3] or anything else, feel free to contact me at <wrlach@gmail.com>.

Exact itinerary:

- Thu Mar 20 : Sat Mar 22: Tokyo, Japan
- Sat Mar 22 : Tue Mar 25: Kyoto, Japan
- Tue Mar 25 : Thu Mar 27: Tokyo, Japan
- Thu Mar 27 : Sun Mar 30: Taipei, Taiwan

I will also be in Taipei the week of the March 31st, though I expect most of my time to be occupied with discussions/activities inside the Taipei office about FirefoxOS performance matters (the Firefox performance team is having a work week there, and I'm tagging along to talk about / hack on Eideticker and other automation stuff).
