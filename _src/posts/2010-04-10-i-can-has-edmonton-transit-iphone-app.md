With [yesterday&#8217;s work][1] out of the way, there weren&#8217;t too many extra steps required before I got a basic version of Transit to Go running for Edmonton. There are definitely bugs and rough edges (the bus names could definitely be better described/formatted, and there&#8217;s some serious geocoder issues), but I think the heavy lifting is out of the way. I guess now would be a good time to open up an invitations to anyone in Edmonton with an iPhone to become part of our free private beta. We&#8217;d love to hear what you think! Just send an email to <wrlach@gmail.com>.
