    Title: A new domain

A few years ago, I fancied the idea of creating my own software consulting business. For some reason, I thought "Masala Labs" would be a cool and witty name for it ("masala" means spice mixture in Hindi, and who doesn't like spicy things?), so I registered the domain along with the associated small business paperwork in Nova Scotia. I only ever had one client, and it was only a few months before I wound up joining a few of my colleagues in founding "The Navarra Group" (which is also now defunct, a story I will perhaps tell at another time), so it never got very huge.

Anyway, I still had my own domain, and I wanted to move my blog from livejournal, which was beginning to jump the shark. The masalalabs domain was mine, so why not use it? I created a wordpress blog, pointed my DNS registration at it, and started writing. This worked well for a while (names don't really matter for random personal blogs), but lately I've been wanting to start a new project and "Masala Labs" doesn't exactly seem like a winning banner for me to put it under.

So I've decided it's time for a bit of a change. I just registered the swiss domain name &#8216;wrla.ch', created a fancy new [landing page][1], and made this blog its first "sub site". More to come.

So, for all 20 of you who are subscribed to my doings, please update your links. For those of you using Google Reader / RSS, the new feed is at [this URL][2]. All the old masalalabs links should at least **work** until the domain expires in a few years, so there's no huge rush. Then again, you'll probably forget if you don't do it now (and thus be deprived of my endless ravings about checkerboarding on mobile Fennec on Android), so why wait?
