I&#8217;ve been working on a new, mobile friendly version of [Nixi][1] on-and-off for the past year and a bit. I&#8217;m not sure when it&#8217;s ever going to be finished, so I thought I might as well post the work-in-progress, which has these noteworthy improvements:

  * Even faster than before (using the [Bootstrap][2] library behind the scenes, no longer using slow canvas library to update map)
  * Sexier graphics (thanks to the aforementioned Bootstrap library)
  * Now uses client side URLs to keep track of state as you navigate through the site. This allows you to bookmark a favorite spot (e.g. your home) and then go back to it later. For example, [this link][3] will give you a list of BIXI docks near [Station C][4], the coworking space I belong to.

If you use [BIXI][5] at all, check it out and let me know what you think!
