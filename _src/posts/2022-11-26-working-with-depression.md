    Title: Working with depression

Been struggling with depression over the past couple of weeks.
Some of this is seasonal (with the shortening of the days), though I wouldn't say it _always_ happens.
Last year at this time I recall feeling the _opposite_ of depressed: that probably had to do with the fact that I knew I was leaving my previous job at Mozilla and wanted to get as much done as possible.
Sometimes a highly motivating life situation can keep it in abeyance.
Nonetheless, it's here now, again, and demands to be dealt with.

What does depression even mean?
It's a bit of a hard thing to pin down, exactly.
But from the perspective of looking after my own well being, I don't think I really need a definition.
What matters are the symptoms, which I'd roughly express as:

- Knowing what I _should_ be doing but not able to do it
- An increase in time spent scanning social media, news sites
- Feelings of low self worth
- Feelings that nothing really matters
- Lack of creativity, improvisation
- An increase in self-referential thinking (this post would be an example of that)

A few things I tend to try to diminish its effects:

- Go outside, expose myself to sunlight. Explore nature.
- Exercise
- Meditate
- Eat less carbohydrates, more vegetables and protein
- Talk to friends
- Do nice things for other people

I don't feel like doing these things but I try with all my might, against all my will, to do them anyway.
Any individual action might not do much: but the cumulative effect of doing _all_ of the above seems to have an impact -- or at least that's what I tell myself.

And yet despite my best efforts, it's not always enough.
I do all of the things in the second list, and yet still find myself suffering in all the ways described by the first.
What do I do then?

I try to understand that there really isn't an escape from unpleasant feeling, and that it's just part of life: glorious and beautiful in its complexity.
I try to be _curious_ about what's going on, even if I think it's all happened before.
If that's not possible, I at least try to be present with it. That's all I can do.
