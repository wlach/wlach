Since my [first Eideticker dashboard post][2] was [so well received][3], I thought I&#8217;d give a quick update on another metric that I just brought online: checkerboarding (a.k.a. the amount of time you spend waiting to see the full page after you do a swipe on your mobile device).

Unfortunately the news here is not as good as before: as the numbers indicate, the new Native Fennec currently performs substantially worse than the version in Android market. This is a known issue, and is currently being tracked in [bug 719447][5].

Next up: Seeing how we do against Google Chrome for Android.
