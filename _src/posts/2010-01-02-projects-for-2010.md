Hurrah, 2010 is upon us!

One new years resolution I have set for myself is to blog more about what I'm working on. I've learned over the last year that the audience of people who care about your projects _in development_ is vanishingly small. Thus, the need for secrecy in order to make a "PR splash" is rather small: announce far and wide when you have something that [people can use][1] by all means, but don't worry too much about talking about what you're working on with the internets.

In this spirit, some projects I'm 99% certain I'll be releasing publicly in 2010:

- **[neocoder][2]** A lightweight geocoding library, with wrapper libraries for your language of choice. Written in C++ using [SQLite][3] and boost regular expressions. Will support both [OpenStreetMap][4] and [GeoBase][5] GML as input. Currently in development on github, hoping to release with routez (as its geocoding component).
- **routez** A generic travel planning web service, written in python using the [django][6] framework and the [libroutez][7] libraries. This is basically the software behind [hbus.ca][1] the goal for 2010 is to clean it up and make it generic by clearing out the Halifax-specific stuff (mostly just the geocoding and site theme stuff at this point), then release it to the public under the [Affero GPL License][8] (was originally going to with GPL, but [Simon Law][9] convinced me otherwise: more on that in a future post).
- **Transit To Go** A dedicated iPhone client for the routez software, developed in collaboration with [Dmitri Dolguikh][10] and [Bill Wilson][11], two talent developers from Halifax. Has some innovative (in my opinion, anyway) details on how things will be viewed. This one's going to be proprietary, but will be affordable and awesome.

Besides this, I have a few more irons in the fire; however, I'm hesistant to talk about them just yet. Just getting the above done in the midst of my work with [Navarra][12] (to say nothing of having a life in there somewhere) is going to be challenging.

Thoughts? Would be particularly interested in hearing from people working on similar projects to neocoder and routez. Despite how it may some times appear, I don't have a NotInventedHere mentality: I've done as an exhaustive survey of the field as I could before deciding to work on my own projects, and what I've found just hasn't been the right fit for what I'm trying to accomplish. However, the world's gotten so damn big that I'm not sure if I'm missing something.
