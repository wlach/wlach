Got this exceedingly strange e-mail yesterday. It's almost a bit tragic. Anyone else seen gotten this?

(BTW, the writing samples, which I won't link to, weren't half bad)

> Hi there,
>
> Hope keeping well. I'm just getting in touch to ask if you're open to reviewing content from freelance writers at Ginger Tea and Channa Masala : if so, I'd love to put together a high-quality article written specifically for the site. I'm 29 and have been working as a professional writer and researcher for five years now, and in that time there isn't a lot I haven't already covered (I've attached a few samples below for you to check out).

> As long as you're happy with the resulting material, you'd be welcome to publish it as you see fit and the content will be owned by you entirely (in that I won't send it to anyone else, either before or after publication).
>
> There is absolutely no charge for this and no strings attached; the only thing I would ask in return is that I'm able to include a link to a site of my choosing within the article : nothing shady or unethical, just one of the professional businesses I freelance for.
>
> Do let me know if you're interested, and if so I can get something written for you over the course of the next few days. Needless to say, the offer is open to any other sites you might own as well as wrla.ch/blog. I appreciate you may not be interested in this kind of mutual back-scratching however, so if I don't hear from you, no offence taken and I won't trouble you again.

> Very best,
