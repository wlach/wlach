Oh glorious day, the Nexus One is [now available][1] for purchase in Canada! 

I&#8217;ve been feeling less and less enthusiastic about the iPhone lately, in particular after the [ridiculous lawsuit against HTC][2]. It&#8217;s no secret that we at [Navarra][3] have been doing quite a bit of work on that platform, as have my associates at [Mindsea][4]. As long as there&#8217;s demand from our clients, that won&#8217;t change, but as an individual I&#8217;m feeling less and less enthusiastic about supporting a company that (through its actions) demonstrates hostility to the ideals of autonomy and innovation that I hold dear. Now that an attractive alternative is available on reasonable terms, I&#8217;m seriously considering switching horses in the not-too-distant future.
