Oh glorious day, the Nexus One is [now available][1] for purchase in Canada!

I've been feeling less and less enthusiastic about the iPhone lately, in particular after the [ridiculous lawsuit against HTC][2]. It's no secret that we at [Navarra][3] have been doing quite a bit of work on that platform, as have my associates at [Mindsea][4]. As long as there's demand from our clients, that won't change, but as an individual I'm feeling less and less enthusiastic about supporting a company that (through its actions) demonstrates hostility to the ideals of autonomy and innovation that I hold dear. Now that an attractive alternative is available on reasonable terms, I'm seriously considering switching horses in the not-too-distant future.
