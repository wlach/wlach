So I haven&#8217;t been blogging much lately. Story of my life, I&#8217;ll try to be a bit more active in the new year.

I&#8217;m now back living in Montr&eacute;al, which has been great. Very sad to leave Halifax and all the [goings][1] [on][2], but I&#8217;ll be back to visit. And I&#8217;m not done with [disruptive transit-related apps][3] for that city. Au contraire. More news on that soon.
