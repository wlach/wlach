So I haven't been blogging much lately. Story of my life, I'll try to be a bit more active in the new year.

I'm now back living in Montr&eacute;al, which has been great. Very sad to leave Halifax and all the [goings][1] [on][2], but I'll be back to visit. And I'm not done with [disruptive transit-related apps][3] for that city. Au contraire. More news on that soon.
