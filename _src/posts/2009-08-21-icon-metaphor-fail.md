Started to use a new piece of hardware at the Navarra office today, which resulted in the following gem being added to the GNOME notification area. Would anyone care to guess what the following icon is supposed to represent?<figure id="attachment_54" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

<img src="/files/2009/08/dock-icon-fail.jpg" alt="Image of crazy status icon in notification area" title="dock-icon-fail" width="277" height="35" class="size-full wp-image-54" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image of crazy status icon in notification area</figcaption></figure>
