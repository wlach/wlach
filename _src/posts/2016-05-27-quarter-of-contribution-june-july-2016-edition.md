Just wanted to announce that, once again, my team ([Mozilla Engineering
Productivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity)) is just about
to start running another [quarter of contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution)
-- a great opportunity for newer community members to dive deep on some of the
projects we're working on, brush up on their programming and problem solving skills, and work with
experienced mentors. You can find more information on this program
[here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Summer_2016).

I've found this program to be a really great experience on both sides -- it's
an opportunity for contributors to really go beyond the "good first bug" style
of patches to having a really substantial impact on some of the projects that
we're working on while gaining lots of software development skills that are useful in
the real world.

Once again, I'm going to be mentoring one or two people on the Perfherder project,
a tool we use to measure and sheriff Firefox performance. If you're inclined to work
on some really interesting data analysis and user interface problems in Python and
JavaScript, please have a look at the [project
page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Perfherder)
and get in touch. :)
