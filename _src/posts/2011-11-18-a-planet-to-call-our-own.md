Just a quick note that a planet for Mozilla Tools &#038; Automation (the so-called &#8220;a team&#8221;) is now up, thanks to Reed Loden. With the exception of [Jeff Hammel][1], everyone there was already being syndicated on [Planet Mozilla][2], but this should offer a more focused feed of our doings for those who can&#8217;t always keep up with the firehose. Have a look:

Who should care? Well, we maintain all the major testing frameworks like Mochitest, Reftest, and Talos as well as automated tooling for QA like [Mozmill][3]. Our latest work is focused on making sure that Firefox is as robust, responsive, and performant as possible on desktop and mobile. In short, if you&#8217;re writing or verifying code from mozilla-central, what we&#8217;re doing probably affects you. Please let us know what you think about our projects and whether there&#8217;s anything we can do to make your job easier: we&#8217;re listening.

**Quick bonus note**: It&#8217;s not immediately obvious (or at least it wasn&#8217;t to me), but Mozilla has some fairly finely tuned infrastructure for running planets. If your team or group wants one, it&#8217;s definitely better to plug into that instead of rolling your own. ðŸ˜‰ Reed Loden is the maintainer and the source [lives in subversion][4].
