Just wanted to give a quick update on some things that have been happening with the
[metrics graphics](https://www.metricsgraphics.org) since I stepped up to help with
maintainership a few months ago:

* [Hamilton](https://github.com/hamilton)'s back as co-maintainer! This has been especially helpful
  as he understands much of the historical context of metricsgraphics better than I do.
* We've merged in a large number of small fixes and improvements into the codebase,
  thanks to myself and a number of other contributors. Special shout-out to Thomas
  Champagne, who has contributed a [large number of nifty new features](https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/commits?author=thomaschampagne).
* We moved the project from Mozilla to its [own organization](https://github.com/metricsgraphics/) on
  github. This feels like a much better way forward for a project which is supposed to be useful
  far outside the bounds of Mozilla, and hopeful makes contributors feel more like the first-class
  citizens of the project that they actually are.
* We have a GSOC intern! As part of the Mozilla GSOC, Yunhao Zheng is going to be working on
  adding rich brushing/zooming support to Metrics Graphics, which should be quite useful for
  visualizing complex data in projects like [Perfherder](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder) ([Project outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KIOJtemqlCBktDdfdjDuS4XhICeaKO3QhNRwbnnf-g/), [Yunhao's proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5422620527296512))
