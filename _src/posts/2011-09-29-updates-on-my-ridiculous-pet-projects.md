1. As you may or may not have noticed, [hbus.ca][1] has been down for the past few weeks. Halifax updated the data but I didn't have a chance to update it. Well, I finally did, and hbus is now up in its former glory (minus a small issue with stops named &#8216;6016_merged_3300509': thanks Metro Transit, time to update [that script][2] to massage your data again!) . I still wonder a bit about why I keep putting time into a site oriented around a city I haven't lived in for over 2 years now (especially when Google Maps arguably does a better job at most things than I do), but there you go!

2. [NIXI][3] is still up and being useful to me, though I'm a little bit disappointed by its uptake from the rest of the world (the site gets like 5-12 unique views a day). What do I need to do for you guys? A mobile version? French localization? I just added support for Washington (Capital Bikeshare) and Boston (Hubway), maybe it'll get some uptake there.

3. Not really my project, but Stephane Guidoin put up an awesome site called [zonecone.ca][4] which helps you find out about traffic obstacles that might delay your journey. It even has a nifty feature where you can create an account, specify a route you take regularly (say, your commute), and it'll automatically notify you if something pops up. As you may have guessed, I'm not the biggest fan of automobiles, but this is still very cool. ðŸ˜‰ This site was originally based on [the map layout template][5] that I announced a few months ago.

4. I have a lettuce plant growing on my new balcony. It's doing ok, though it will probably have to be brought in soon due to frost. Will it get enough sun? Can I prevent my cat from eating it? Will it make a delicious salad? Stay tuned!
