One of my frustrations with the Linux desktop is the lack of an email client that&#8217;s in the same league as GMail or Apple&#8217;s mail.app. [Thunderbird][2] is ok as far as it goes (I use it for my day-to-day Mozilla correspondence) but I miss having a decent conversation view of email (yes, I tried the [conversation view extension][3] &#8212; while impressive in some ways, it ultimately didn&#8217;t work particularly well for me) and the search functionality is rather slow and cumbersome. I&#8217;d like to be optimistic about these problems being fixed at some point&#8230; but after nearly 2 years of using the product without much visible improvement my expectation of that happening is rather low.

The [Yorba][4] non-profit recently started a [fundraiser][5] to work on the next edition of Geary, an email client which I hope will fill the niche that I&#8217;m talking about. It&#8217;s pretty rough around the edges still, but even at this early stage the conversation view is beautiful and more or less exactly what I want. The example of Shotwell (their photo management application) suggests that they know a thing or two about creating robust and useable software, not a common thing in this day and age. In any case, their pitch was compelling enough for me to donate a few dollars to the cause. If you care about having a great email experience that is completely under your control (and not that of an advertising or product company with their own agenda), then maybe you could too?
