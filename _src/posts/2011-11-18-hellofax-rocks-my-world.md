It's kind of rare for me to pimp out products and services on my blog, but I'm going to do so just this once.

I really despise faxes, but occasionally I do have to send them in the course of some of the admin work I still do on the side for my old consulting company (address changes, etc.). If you're in a similar boat, you really owe it to yourself to check out [hellofax.com][1]. It's about three gazillion times better than any other similar service that I've tried (which were all embarassingly bad: I'd sooner just go to a copy shop) and has saved me hours and hours of time and frustration.
