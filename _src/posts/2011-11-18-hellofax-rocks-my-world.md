It&#8217;s kind of rare for me to pimp out products and services on my blog, but I&#8217;m going to do so just this once. 

I really despise faxes, but occasionally I do have to send them in the course of some of the admin work I still do on the side for my old consulting company (address changes, etc.). If you&#8217;re in a similar boat, you really owe it to yourself to check out [hellofax.com][1]. It&#8217;s about three gazillion times better than any other similar service that I&#8217;ve tried (which were all embarassingly bad: I&#8217;d sooner just go to a copy shop) and has saved me hours and hours of time and frustration.
