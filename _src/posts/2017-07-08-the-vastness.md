Had a good all hands with the rest of Mozilla in San Francisco (at least
those able and willing to attend due to the current political situation
in the U.S.). I stayed a few extra days to hang out with some of my friends
who had moved to S.F. On Sunday we went to Muir Woods, where I took this
picture:

It occurred to me at the time that I took that photo that pretty much
every sensory receptor in my optic nerve was registering the signal of
some kind of life. Thousands of beings (trees, clover, moss,
lichens) in turn made up of trillions upon trillions of tiny beings (cells,
bacteria) all conscious and interacting with each other in ways that I can
barely begin to understand.
