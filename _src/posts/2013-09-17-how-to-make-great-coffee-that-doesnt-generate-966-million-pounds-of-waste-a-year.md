    Title: How to make great coffee that doesn&#8217;t generate 966 million pounds of waste a year

I was kind of appalled today to see this:

I initially thought this had to be a tall tale told by hippies, but doing a back of the envelope calculation, I realized that such a figure is entirely possible. Assume each packet weighs 0.05 pounds. Typing that into python I get:  
`<br />
>>> 966*(10**6)/0.05<br />
19320000000.0`

19 billion packets. Seems awfully big. But divide that by, say, 10 million people:

`>>> x = 966*(10**6)/0.05<br />
>>> x/10**7<br />
1932.0`

1932 cups. Hmm, still seems big. That&#8217;s more than 5 cups a day. But if we say 30 million people are drinking this stuff, we rapidly get to the zone of plausibility.

People, it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. You can have *way better* coffee that produces *zero* waste for only marginally more effort. Allow me to present the Will method of coffee production. First off, you use this thing:

[<img src="/files/2013/09/bialetti_coffee_maker-767x1024.jpg" alt="bialetti_coffee_maker" width="640" height="854" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-934" srcset="/files/2013/09/bialetti_coffee_maker-224x300.jpg 224w, /files/2013/09/bialetti_coffee_maker-767x1024.jpg 767w, /files/2013/09/bialetti_coffee_maker.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />][2]

I have tried alternatives: french presses, filter coffee, &#8220;cowboy&#8221; percolators, even &#8220;professional&#8221; espresso makers. I maintain that the Bialetti filter produces the best cup of coffee: one full cup of espresso goodness. Not too strong, not too weak. Just perfect. Add some milk and you have an amazing caf&eacute; au lait. Of course, part of getting the best cup is using the right beans. If you&#8217;re brewing at home, you can afford to go a little fancy. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m currently using:

[<img src="/files/2013/09/portlandia_coffee-767x1024.jpg" alt="portlandia_coffee" width="640" height="854" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-937" srcset="/files/2013/09/portlandia_coffee-224x300.jpg 224w, /files/2013/09/portlandia_coffee-767x1024.jpg 767w, /files/2013/09/portlandia_coffee.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />][3]

Yep, that&#8217;s right. A slice of Portlandia. Got this bag of espresso from Cafe Myriad, a rather upscale coffee joint. I think it was 15 dollars. A small bag like this is good for 30 cups or so. A keurig k-pack is [$17.45 for 24][4]. I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m still ahead. If you&#8217;re on a tighter budget you can get fair trade beans for cheaper ($10 a pound?) from Santropol in Montr&eacute;al. Or whatever. Even generic stuff is probably fine (though I encourage fair trade if you can possibly afford it).

And what do I do with the waste? The only waste product of the Bialetti filter is coffee grinds. If I happened to live in a borough of Montr&eacute;al with composting, I could dump it there. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t (if you live in NDG, please vote for [these people][5] in the upcoming municipal election; municipal composting is part of their platform, amongst other awesomeness) so I have a vermicompost. My morning ritual is dump yesterday&#8217;s coffee grinds into this bin:

[<img src="/files/2013/09/vermicompost_pic-1024x934.jpg" alt="vermicompost_pic" width="640" height="583" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-935" srcset="/files/2013/09/vermicompost_pic-300x273.jpg 300w, /files/2013/09/vermicompost_pic-1024x934.jpg 1024w, /files/2013/09/vermicompost_pic.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />][6]

&#8230; and then my numerous worms do the work of turning it into beautiful soil which I use in my [balcony garden][7] to grow tomotatos, kale, swiss chard, basil, and oregano. 

What I want to emphasize most of all is that my ritual *takes very little time*. Scraping out and cleaning my Bialetti in the worm compost bin takes around minute. Refilling it with water and coffee takes maybe 30 seconds. Yes, once a year I have to take the worm trailings out of my vermicompost bin. That takes longer (maybe 30 minutes to an hour) but it&#8217;s a once a year thing and you avoid having to go to the store to buy fertilizer. Less waste. Way better coffee. Only a marginally more time spent. To me, this is a no-brainer.
