A bit quiet here for the last few months. What's been happening?

1. I got married and had a [wonderful honeymoon][1] in France.
2. I started a fantastic new job with Mozilla's [tools &#038; automation][2] group. Currently working on bringing down the build/test times for Firefox (part of a project called [GoFaster][3]), which has been really interesting.
3. I moved into a fantastic new apartment in an old victorian building near Vend&ocirc;me metro.

In short, life has been treating me really well! More updates soon.
