He sits on the edge of my couch, stoic. At rest, yet alert for anything to happen at any moment. Whether that be a mouse running across the room (fat chance here) or me getting up to go into the kitchen. I took this picture just after zazen (meditating) &#8212; I struggle and struggle and yet right beside me sits a creature that constantly practices in the highest form (shikantaza, &#8220;just sitting&#8221;) without even trying. An example for me to follow?
