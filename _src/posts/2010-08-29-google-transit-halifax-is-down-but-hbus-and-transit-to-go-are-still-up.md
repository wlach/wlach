Due to some schedule adjustments, it appears as if Metro Transit's Google Transit is [temporarily out of service][1] while they wait for Google to process their new transit feed.

However, fear not! Unlike Google, obsessive compulsive computer programmer William Lachance works on weekends for free (or the low, low price of $1.99 in the case of iPhone applications) so your thirst for updated transit information can be satisfied. I link to these things often enough on this blog, but here they are again, for the benefit of first time viewers:

- [hbus.ca][2]
- [Transit to Go][3] </ul>
  In other news, it appears as if Metro Transit has finally seen the light and made their transit information available to anyone who wants it. I would like to think that I might have had [something to do with this][4], but I honestly have no idea. Anyway, if you want to check it out, it's available [here][5].
