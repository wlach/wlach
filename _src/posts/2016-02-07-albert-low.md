I was saddened to find out last week that the person who introduced me
to Zen practice three years ago, Albert Low, has passed away. Albert was the
teacher of the [Montreal Zen Center](http://www.zenmontreal.ca/), which I was
a member of for a brief period (6 months) in 2014 before I moved to Toronto
and started practicing at [the center](http://torontozen.org/) here.

Albert's instruction was the gateway to a practice that has had a profound
impact on my life. More than anything, he helped me understand Zen as
something that one could incorporate directly into daily life. I will remain
forever grateful.
