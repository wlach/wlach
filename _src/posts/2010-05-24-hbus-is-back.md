After a month long hiatus, I finally had a chance to get [hbus.ca][1] back into a working state. The big difference is that we're now using the [official HRM transit data][2]. Lots more remains to be done to make this site competitive for 2010 (most of the recent work has been back-end infrastructure stuff), but at least it's usable again.
