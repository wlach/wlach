    Title: The humble blog

I've been thinking a lot about markdown, presentation, dashboards, and
other frontendy sorts of things lately, partly inspired by my work on [Iodide] last
year, partly inspired by my recent works on [docs.telemetry.mozilla.org]. I haven't fully
formed my thoughts on this yet, but in general I think blogs (for some value of "blog")
are still a great way to communicate ideas and concepts to an interested audience.

Like most organizations, Mozilla's gone down the path of Google Docs and Slack which
makes me more than a little sad: it feels like good ideas disappear down the memory hole
_super_ quickly using these tools, not to mention the fact that they are closed-by-default
(even to people inside Mozilla!). My view on "open" is a bit more nuanced than it used to be:
I no longer think everything need be all-public, all-the-time-- but I still think talking about
and through our ideas (even if imperfectly formed) with a broad audience builds trust and leads
to better outcomes.

Is there some way we can blend some of these old school ideas (blogs, newsgroups, open discussion
forums) with better technology and social practices? Let's find out.
