Ok, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that the content on this blog has been rather nerd-heavy, somewhat breaking the promise I made when I first started it to have &#8220;approximately the same mix of personal, political and technical content&#8221; as my [old livejournal][1]. I&#8217;ve been meaning to correct that for a while, but as often happens, other things have taken priority. 

Well, it&#8217;s time to make a stab at it.

I&#8217;ve noticed that a good numbers of searches on this blog have been for ginger tea and/or channa masala (chickpea curry). Must have something to do with this blog&#8217;s name.  Unsurprisingly, these hits tend to have a high bounce rate (people coming to the site and immediately leaving, probably dissatisfied). Well, it&#8217;s about time these people get satisfaction with these wonderful, easy to follow recipes:

**Channa Masala** (recipe courtesy of [Mark C&ocirc;t&eacute;][2])

1 medium-sized onion  
1 clove garlic  
1 2-cm cube ginger  
2-3 fresh or dried chilis  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp turmeric  
1 small tomato  
2-3 curry leaves  
1 540 mL can chick peas  
1 tsp garam masala

Saute onion, garlic, and chilis as usual, adding ginger at the same time as the garlic. Place the tomato in boiling water until you are easily able to remove the skin. Add salt, turmeric, tomato, and curry leaves, and cook for another minute. Add chick peas and cover with water. Cook for 15-20 minutes, until water is absorbed and chick peas are tender. Add garam masala, stir, and serve. 

**Ginger Tea** (very informal recipe)

1 hunk of ginger, coarsely chopped (perhaps 4 tablespoons worth)  
4 tablespoons honey  
3-4 cups water

Put above ingredients into pot, at maximum heat. Bring to boil. Turn heat to low, let cook for 30 minutes or so. Consume. It&#8217;s the best medicine for a cold that i know.
