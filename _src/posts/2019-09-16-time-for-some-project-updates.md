    Title: Time for some project updates

I've been a bit bad about updating this blog over the past year or so, though
this hasn't meant there haven't been things to talk about. For the next couple
weeks, I'm going to try to give some updates on the projects I have been
spending time on in the past year, both old and new. I'm going to begin with
some of the less-loved things I've been working on, partially in an attempt to
motivate some forward-motion on things that I believe are rather important to
Mozilla.

More to come.
