    Title: Metrics Graphics: Stepping back for a while

Just a note that I've decided to step back from
[metrics graphics](https://metricsgraphicsjs.org) maintenance for the time
being, which means that the project is essentially unowned. This has sort of been the
case for a while, but I figured I should probably make it official.

If you follow the link to the [metrics graphics
repository](https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/), you'll note
that the version has been bumped to "3.0-alpha3". I was *this close* to making
one last new release this afternoon but decided I didn't want to potentially
break existing users who were fine using the last "official" version (v3.0 bumps
the version of d3 used to "5", among other breaking changes). I'd encourage people
who want to continue using the library to make a fork and publish a copy under their
user or organization name on npm.
