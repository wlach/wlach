More on this to come, but just a quick note that the client-side URL schema for the Eideticker dashboard has been changed, as we now gather benchmarks for more than one device (Samsung Galaxy Nexus benchmarks FTW). To get the new and improved dashboard, please just go to the root:

<http://wrla.ch/eideticker/dashboard>

Old style URLs like `http://wrla.ch/eideticker/dashboard/#/taskjs-scrolling/checkerboard` will no longer work. Sorry for any broken links, this is the price of progress. ðŸ˜‰

Note that some benchmarks for the Galaxy Nexus are still missing. This is a known problem and will be fixed soon.
