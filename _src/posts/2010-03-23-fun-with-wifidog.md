Because I don&#8217;t have enough spare time projects (*this is a joke*), I decided to take on the task of adding a must-requested special iPhone/iPod-touch friendly view for the [WifiDog][1] authentication server (used by the infamous [Île Sans Fil][2]) after being inspired by the WifiDog camp held a few weeks ago at Station C. I finally finally finished up a prototype today. It&#8217;s a bit of a hack, but a relatively clean one&#8211; hopefully some version of it can be integrated into trunk, and users with mobile devices will have a better experience when they&#8217;re on the go in Montr&eacute;al (or any other area with a community-oriented wifidog deployment: I hear there&#8217;s lots).

For those interested in grubby details, you can track the progress of this work on the [WifiDog ticket tracker][3].
