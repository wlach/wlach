Hi! My name is William Lachance, though most people just call me "Will".

I'm an (early, as of this writing) fortysomething developer of software in Toronto, Ontario, Canada currently working at [Voltus] on energy market integrations.

From 2011-2022, I worked at [Mozilla] (as in [Firefox]) in [Data Engineering] and [Engineering Productivity].
Virtually everything I did at that time in the open, so much of the historical content on this blog has to do with my work there.

I've worked on a bunch of things over the course of my career, but a unifying principle has been trying to help people understand the world around them.
I try to help people think critically about business problems and build computational systems to help them do this.

More broadly, I am interested in open systems, accountability, and helping people achieve their potential.

Other random facts:

- I am a nominal Zen Buddhist. I practice at the [Toronto Zen Centre].
- I try to live simply: I use a bicycle for most forms of local transportation and try
  to limit my longer-distance travel to what's strictly necessary.
- I am _mostly_ vegetarian (sometimes I eat mussels, oysters and other invertebrates).
- I prefer they/them pronouns.

I try to be judicious about using social media. That said, there's a bunch of places you can find me:

- [mastodon] (semi-frequently updated)
- [twitter] (trying to migrate to Mastodon)
- [instagram] (infrequently)
- [dreamwidth] (for more personal stuff, also infrequent)
- [linkedin]
- [github]
