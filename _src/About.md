# About

 Hi! My name is William Lachance, though most people just call me "Will".

I'm a thirtysomething developer of software in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
currently working for [Mozilla] in the [Engineering Productivity] group.

I have an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and try to
find useful ways of applying research in these areas to problems faced by my
employer. I am currently trying to figure out how to better identify and resolve
performance regressions in the Firefox family of products.

This blog is mostly work related, but occasionally I talk about other things.

Miscellaneous facts about Will:

* Practices hot yoga and zazen meditation
* Rides a bicycle most of the time, even in the Canadian winter
* Mostly vegetarian (sometimes eats mussels and oysters)
* Often refers to self in third person
