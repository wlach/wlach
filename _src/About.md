Hi! My name is William Lachance, though most people just call me "Will".

I'm an (early, as of this writing) fortysomething developer of software in
Toronto, Ontario, Canada currently working for [Mozilla] in the [Data Engineering]
group (formerly in the now-defunct [Engineering Productivity] organization).

I've worked on a bunch of things over the course of my career here (big themes
have been automation, browser performance, and stability), but the unifying principle 
is me trying to help people understand the world around them. I try to help people 
think critically about data and build computational systems that help them do this.

More broadly, I am interested in open systems, accountability, and helping people
achieve their potential.

Other random facts:

* I am a nominal Zen Buddhist. I practice at the [Toronto Zen Centre].
* I try to live simply: I use a bicycle for most forms of local transportation and try
  to limit my longer-distance travel to what's strictly necessary.
* I am *mostly* vegetarian (sometimes I eat mussels, oysters and other invertebrates)

I've closed down most of my traditional social media accounts, but there are
a few places you can still find me:

* [instagram] (infrequently)
* [dreamwidth] (for more personal stuff, also infrequent)
* [github]
* [linkedin]
