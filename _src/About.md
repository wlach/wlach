# About

Hi! My name is William Lachance, though most people just call me "Will".

I'm an (early, as of this writing) fortysomething developer of software in
Toronto, Ontario, Canada currently working for [Mozilla] in the [Data Engineering]
group (formerly in the now-defunct [Engineering Productivity] organization).

I've worked on a bunch of things over the course of my career here (big themes
have been automation, browser performance, and stability), but a chief
unifying principle is me trying to help people understand the world around them.
I try to help people think critically about data and build both backend and
frontend systems that help them do this.

This blog is mostly work related, but occasionally I talk about other things.

Miscellaneous facts about Will:

* Practices hot yoga and zazen meditation
* Rides a bicycle most of the time, even in the Canadian winter
* Mostly vegetarian (sometimes eats mussels and oysters)
* Often refers to self in third person

I've closed down most of my traditional social media accounts, but there are
a few places you can still find me:

* [flickr]
* [github]
* [linkedin]
