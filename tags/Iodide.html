<p>Last week, Brendan Colloran <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/">announced Iodide</a>, a new take on scientific collaboration and reporting that I&rsquo;ve been really happy to contribute to over the past year-and-a-bit. I&rsquo;ve been describing it to people I meet as kind of "<a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a> meets <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> " but that doesn&rsquo;t quite do it justice. I&rsquo;d recommend reading Brendan&rsquo;s blog post (and taking a look at our <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io">demonstration site</a>) to get the full picture.</p>

<p>One question that I&rsquo;ve heard asked (including on Brendan&rsquo;s post) is why we chose a rather conventional and old technology (<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) for the server backend. Certainly, Iodide has not been shy about building with relatively new or experimental technologies for other parts (e.g. Python on WebAssembly for the notebooks, React/Redux for the frontend). Why not complete the cycle by using a new-fangled JavaScript web server like, I don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>? And while we&rsquo;re at it, what&rsquo;s with iodide&rsquo;s ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a>? Don&rsquo;t you know <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is the only legitimate way to expose your backend to the world in 2019?</p>

<p>The great urban theorist of the twentieth century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> has a quote I love:</p>

<p>
 <i>“Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.”</i></p>

<p>Laura Thompson (an engineering director at Mozilla) has restated this wisdom in a software development context as <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lauraxt/build-exciting-things-with-boring-technologies">&ldquo;Build exciting things with boring technologies&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It so happened that the server was not an area Iodide was focusing on for innovation (at least initially), so it made much, much more sense to use something proven and battle-tested for the server side deployment. I&rsquo;d used Django for a number of projects at Mozilla before this one (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder">Treeherder/Perfherder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/missioncontrol/">Mission Control</a>) and have been wildly impressed by the project&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/">database access layer</a>, and support for building a standardized API via the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a> add-on. Not to mention the fact that so much of Mozilla&rsquo;s in-house ops and web development expertise is based around this framework (I could name off probably 5 or 6 internal business systems based around the Django stack, in addition to Treeherder), so deploying Iodide and getting help building it would be something of a known quantity.</p>

<p>Only slightly more than half a year since I began work on the iodide server, we now have both a publicly accessible site for others to experiment with <em>and</em> an internal one for Mozilla&rsquo;s business needs. It&rsquo;s hard to say what would have happened had I chosen something more experimental to build Iodide&rsquo;s server piece, but at the very least there would have been a substantial learning curve involved &mdash; in addition to engineering effort to fill in the gaps where the new technology is not yet complete &mdash; which would have meant less time to innovate where it really mattered. Django&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/">database migration system</a>, for example, took years to come to fruition and I&rsquo;m not aware of anything comparable in the world of JavaScript web frameworks.</p>

<p>As we move ahead, we may find places where applying new backend server technologies makes sense. Heck, maybe we&rsquo;ll chose to rewrite the whole thing at some point. But to get to launch, chosing a bunch of boring, tested software for this portion of Iodide was (in my view) absolutely the right decision and I make no apologies for it.</p>
