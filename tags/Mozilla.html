    <h2><a href="/blog/2020/05/a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org/">A principled reorganization of docs.telemetry.mozilla.org</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">May 11th, 2020</p>
    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>(this post is aimed primarily at an internal audience, but I thought I&rsquo;d go ahead and make it public as a blog post)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a bunch over the past few months about the Mozilla data organization&rsquo;s documentation story. We have a first class data platform here at Mozilla, but using it to answer questions, especially for newer employees, can be quite intimidating. As we continue our collective journey to becoming a modern data-driven organization, part of the formula for unlocking this promise is making the tools and platforms we create accessible to a broad internal audience.</p>

<p>My data peers are a friendly group of people and we have historically been good at answering questions on forums like the #fx-metrics slack channel: we&rsquo;ll keep doing this. That said, our time is limited: we need a common resource for helping bring people up to speed on how to use the data platform to answer common questions.</p>

<p>Our documentation site, <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org">docs.telemetry.mozilla.org</a>, was meant to be this resource: however in the last couple of years an understanding of its purpose has been (at least partially) lost and it has become somewhat overgrown with content that isn&rsquo;t very relevant to those it&rsquo;s intended to help.</p>

<p>This post&rsquo;s goal is to re-establish a mission for our documentation site &mdash; towards the end, some concrete proposals on what to change are also outlined.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-audience">Setting the audience</h2>

<p>docs.telemetry.mozilla.org was and is meant to be a resource useful for <em>data practitioners</em> within Mozilla.</p>

<p>Examples of different data practioners and their use cases:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A data scientist performing an experiment analysis</li>
 <li>A data analyst producing a report on the effectiveness of a recent marketing campaign</li>
 <li>A Firefox engineer trying to understand the performance characteristics of a new feature</li>
 <li>A technical product manager trying to understand the characteristics of a particular user segment</li>
 <li>A quality assurance engineer trying to understand the severity of a Firefox crash</li></ul>

<p>There are a range of skills that these different groups bring to the table, but there are some common things we expect a data practitioner to have, whatever their formal job description:</p>

<ul>
 <li>At least some programming and analytical experience</li>
 <li>Comfortable working with and understanding complex data systems with multiple levels of abstraction (for example: the relationship between the Firefox browser which produces Telemetry data and the backend system which processes it)</li>
 <li>The time necessary to dig into details</li></ul>

<p>This also <em>excludes</em> a few groups:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Senior leadership or executives: they are of course free to use docs.telemetry.mozilla.org if helpful, but it is expected that the type of analytical work covered by the documentation will normally be done by a data practitioner and that relevant concepts and background information will be explained <em>to them</em> (in the form of high-level dashboards, presentations, etc.).</li>
 <li>Data Engineering: some of the material on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org may be incidentally useful to this internal audience, but explaining the full details of the data platform itself belongs elsewhere.</li></ul>

<h2 id="what-do-these-users-need">What do these users need?</h2>

<p>In general, a data practitioner is trying to answer a specific set of questions in the context of an exploration. There are a few things that they need:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A working knowledge of how to use the technological tools to answer the questions they might have: for example, how to create a SQL query counting the median value of a particular histogram for a particular usage segment.</li>
 <li>A set of guidelines on best practices on how to measure specific things: for example, we want our people using our telemetry systems to use well-formulated practices for measuring things like &ldquo;Monthly Active Users&rdquo; rather than re-inventing such things themselves.</li></ul>

<h2 id="what-serves-this-need">What serves this need?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, Ryan Harter <a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/lit-review.html">did an extensive literature review</a> on writing documentation on technical subjects - the take away from this exploration is that the global consensus is that we should focus most of our attention on writing practical tutorials which enables our users to perform specific tasks in the service of the above objective.</p>

<p>There is a proverb, allegedly attributed to Confucius which goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>&ldquo;I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The understanding we want to build is how to use our data systems and tools to answer questions. Some knowledge of how our data platform works is no doubt necessary to accomplish this, but it is mostly functional knowledge we care about imparting to data practitioners: the best way to build this understanding is to guide users in performing tasks.</p>

<p>This makes sense intuitively, but it is also borne out by the <em>data</em> that this is what our users are looking for. Looking through the top pages on Google Analytics, virtually all of them<sup><a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> refer either to a cookbook or howto guide:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="/files/2020/05/docs-tmo-ga.png" alt="" />
 <p class="caption"></p></div>

<p>Happily, this allows us to significantly narrow our focus for docs.telemetry.mozilla.org. We no longer need to worry about:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Providing lists or summaries of data tools available inside Mozilla<sup><a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup>: we can talk about tools only as needed in the context of tasks they want to accomplish. We may want to keep such a list handy elsewhere for some other reason (e.g. internal auditing purposes), but we can safely say that it belongs somewhere else, like the Mozilla wiki, mana, or the telemetry.mozilla.org portal.</li>
 <li>Detailed reference on the technical details of the data platform implementation. Links to this kind of material can be surfaced inside the documentation where relevant, but it is expected that an implementation reference will normally be stored and presented within the context of the tools themselves (a good example would be <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/gcp-ingestion/">the existing documentation for GCP ingestion</a>).</li>
 <li>Detailed reference on all data sets, ping types, or probes: hand-written documentation for this kind of information is difficult to keep up to date with manual processes<sup><a href="#2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-05-11-a-principled-reorganization-of-docs-telemetry-mozilla-org-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup> and is best generated automatically and browsed with tools like the <a href="https://probes.telemetry.mozilla.org/">probe dictionary</a>.</li>
 <li>Detailed reference material on how to submit Telemetry. While an overview of how to <em>think about</em> submitting telemetry may be in scope (recall that we consider Firefox engineers a kind of data practitioner), the details are really a seperate topic that is better left to another resource which is closer to the implementation (for example, the <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/">Firefox Source Documentation</a> or the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html">Glean SDK reference</a>).</li></ul>

<p>Scanning through the above, you&rsquo;ll see a common theme: avoid overly detailed reference material. The above is not to say that we should avoid background documentation altogether. For example, an understanding of how our data pipeline works is key to understanding how up-to-date a dashboard is expected to be. However, this type of documentation should be written bearing in mind the audience (focusing on what they need to know as data practitioners) and should be surfaced towards the end of the documentation as <em>supporting material</em>.</p>

<p>As an exception, there is also a very small amount of reference documentation which we want to put at top-level because it is so important: for example the <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/metrics/index.html">standard metrics</a> page describes how we define &ldquo;MAU&rdquo; and &ldquo;DAU&rdquo;: these are measures that we want to standardize in the organization, and not have someone re-invent every time they produce an analysis or report. However, we should be very cautious about how much of this &ldquo;front facing&rdquo; material we include: if we overwhelm our audience with details right out of the gate, they are apt to ignore them.</p>

<h2 id="concrete-actions">Concrete actions</h2>

<ul>
 <li>We should continue working on tutorials on how to perform common tasks: this includes not only the low-level guides that we currently have (e.g. BigQuery and SQL tutorials) but also information on how to effectively use our higher-level, more accessible tools like GLAM and GUD to answer questions.</li>
 <li>Medium term, we should remove the per-dataset documentation and replace it with a graphical tool for browsing this type of information (perhaps <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog">Google Data Catalog</a>). Since this is likely to be a rather involved project, we can keep the existing documentation for now &mdash; but for new datasets, we should encourage their authors to write tutorials on how to use them effectively (assuming they are of broad general interest) instead of hand-creating schema definitions that are likely to go out of date quickly.</li>
 <li>We should set clear expectations and guidelines of what does and doesn&rsquo;t belong on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org as part of a larger style guide. This style guide should be referenced somewhere prominent (perhaps as part of a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository">pull request template</a>) so that historical knowledge of what this resource is for isn&rsquo;t lost.</li></ul>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2020/05/this-week-in-glean-mozregression-telemetry-part-2/">This Week in Glean: mozregression telemetry (part 2)</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">May 8th, 2020</p>
    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/Telemetry.html">Telemetry</a>  <a href="/tags/Glean.html">Glean</a>  <a href="/tags/mozregression.html">mozregression</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p><em>(“This Week in Glean” is a series of blog posts that the Glean Team at Mozilla is using to try to communicate better about our work. They could be release notes, documentation, hopes, dreams, or whatever: so long as it is inspired by Glean. You can find <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/twig.html">an index of all TWiG posts online.</a>)</em></p>

<p><em>This is a special guest post by non-Glean-team member William Lachance!</em></p>

<p>This is a continuation of an exploration of adding Glean-based telemetry to a python application, in this case <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression">mozregression</a>, a tool for automatically finding the source of Firefox regressions (breakage).</p>

<p>When we left off <a href="/blog/2020/02/this-week-in-glean-special-guest-post-mozregression-telemetry-part-1/">last time</a>, we had written some test scripts and verified that the data was visible in the debug viewer.</p>

<h2 id="adding-telemetry-to-mozregression-itself">Adding Telemetry to mozregression itself</h2>

<p>In many ways, this is pretty similar to what I did inside the sample application: the only significant difference is that these are shipped inside a Python application that is meant to be be installable via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a>. This means we need to specify the <code>pings.yaml</code> and <code>metrics.yaml</code> (located inside the <code>mozregression</code> subirectory) as package data inside <code>setup.py</code>:</p>

<div class="brush: py">
 <div class="colorful">
  <pre><span></span><span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"mozregression"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="n">package_data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">"mozregression"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"*.yaml"</span><span class="p">]},</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>There were also a number of Glean SDK enhancements which we determined were necessary. Most notably, Michael Droettboom added 32-bit Windows wheels to the Glean SDK, which we need to make building the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/quickstart.html#gui">mozregression GUI</a> on Windows possible. In addition, some minor changes needed to be made to Glean&rsquo;s behaviour for it to work correctly with a command-line tool like mozregression &mdash; for example, Glean used to assume that Telemetry would always be disabled via a GUI action so that it would send a deletion ping, but this would obviously not work in an application like mozregression where there is only a configuration file &mdash; so for this case, Glean needed to be modified to check if it had been disabled <em>between</em> runs.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Mike (and others on the Glean team) for so patiently listening to my concerns and modifying Glean accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="getting-data-review">Getting Data Review</h2>

<p>At Mozilla, we don&rsquo;t just allow random engineers like myself to start collecting data in a product that we ship (even a semi-internal like mozregression). We have <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection">a process</a>, overseen by Data Stewards to make sure the information we gather is actually answering important questions and doesn&rsquo;t unnecessarily collect personally identifiable information (e.g. email addresses).</p>

<p>You can see the specifics of how this worked out in the case of mozregression in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581647#c9">bug 1581647</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Glean has some fantastic utilities for generating markdown-based documentation on what information is being collected, which I have made available on GitHub:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/master/docs/glean/metrics.md">https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/master/docs/glean/metrics.md</a></p>

<p>The generation of this documentation is <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/3454e1eafe83f53a84cb6b10f46649320d5ed097/.travis.yml#L57">hooked up to mozregression&rsquo;s continuous integration</a>, so we can sure it&rsquo;s up to date.</p>

<p>I also added <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/documentation/telemetry.html">a quick note</a> to mozregression&rsquo;s web site describing the feature, along with (very importantly) instructions on how to turn it off.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-data-ingestion">Enabling Data Ingestion</h2>

<p>Once a Glean-based project has passed data review, getting our infrastructure to ingest it is pretty straightforward. Normally <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/adding-glean-to-your-project.html#adding-metadata-about-your-project-to-the-pipeline">we would suggest just filing a bug</a> and let us (the data team) handle the details, but since I&rsquo;m <em>on</em> that team, I&rsquo;m going to go a (little bit) of detail into how the sausage is made.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, we have a collection of ETL (extract-transform-load) scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/">probe-scraper repository</a> which are responsible for parsing the ping and probe metadata files that I added to mozregression in the step above and then automatically creating BigQuery tables and updating our ingestion machinery to insert data passed to us there.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s quite a bit of complicated machinery being the scenes to make this all work, but since it&rsquo;s already in place, adding a new thing like this is relatively simple. The changeset I submitted as part of a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/probe-scraper/pull/184">pull request</a> to probe-scraper was all of 9 lines long:</p>

<h2 id="a-pretty-graph">A Pretty Graph</h2>

<p>With the probe scraper change merged and deployed, we can now start querying! A number of tables are automatically created according to the schema outlined above: notably &ldquo;live&rdquo; and &ldquo;stable&rdquo; tables corresponding to the usage ping. Using <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html">sql.telemetry.mozilla.org</a> we can start exploring what&rsquo;s out there. Here&rsquo;s a quick query I wrote up:</p>

<p>&hellip; which generates a chart like this:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="/files/2020/05/mozregression-variant-usage.png" alt="" />
 <p class="caption"></p></div>

<p>This chart represents the absolute volume of mozregression usage since April 14th 2020 (around the time when we first released a version of mozregression with Glean telemetry), grouped by mozregression &ldquo;variant&rdquo; (GUI, console, and mach) and date - you can see that (unsurprisingly?) the GUI has the highest usage. I&rsquo;ll talk about this more in an upcoming installment, speaking of&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re not done yet! Next time, we&rsquo;ll look into making a public-facing dashboard demonstrating these results and making an aggregated version of the mozregression telemetry data publicly accessible to researchers and the general public. If we&rsquo;re lucky, there might even be a bit of <em>data science</em>. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Just a quick note that, as a side-effect of the work I mentioned a while ago to <a href="/blog/2020/02/this-week-in-glean-special-guest-post-mozregression-telemetry-part-1/">add telemetry to mozregression</a>, mozregression now has a graphical Mac client! It&rsquo;s a bit of a pain to install (since it&rsquo;s unsigned), but likely worlds easier for the average person to get going than the command-line version. Please feel free to <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/install.html">point people to it</a> if you&rsquo;re looking to get a regression range for a MacOS-specific problem with Firefox.</p>

<p>More details: The <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/dev/python/index.html">Glean Python SDK</a>, which <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/documentation/telemetry.html">mozregression now uses for telemetry</a>, requires Python 3. This provided the impetus to port the GUI itself to Python 3 and PySide2 (the modern incarnation of PyQt), which brought with it a much easier installation/development experience for the GUI on platforms like Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to producing GUI binaries for the Linux yet, but it should not be much work.</p>

<p>Speaking of Glean, mozregression, and Telemetry, stay tuned for more updates on that soon. It&rsquo;s been an adventure!</p>

<p><em>(“This Week in Glean” is a series of blog posts that the Glean Team at Mozilla is using to try to communicate better about our work. They could be release notes, documentation, hopes, dreams, or whatever: so long as it is inspired by Glean. You can find <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/twig.html">an index of all TWiG posts online.</a>)</em></p>

<p><em>This is a special guest post by non-Glean-team member William Lachance!</em></p>

<p>As I <a href="/blog/2019/09/mozregression-update-python-3-edition/">mentioned last time</a> I talked about <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/">mozregression</a>, I have been thinking about adding some telemetry to the system to better understand the usage of this tool, to justify some part of Mozilla spending some cycles maintaining and improving it (assuming my intuition that this tool is heavily used is confirmed).</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the Telemetry client team has been working on a new library for measuring these types of things in a principled way called <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html">Glean</a>, which even has python bindings! Using this has the potential in saving a lot of work: not only does Glean provide a framework for submitting data, our backend systems are automatically set up to process data submitted via into Glean into <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a> tables, which can then easily be queried using tools like <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html">sql.telemetry.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>I thought it might be useful to go through some of what I&rsquo;ve been exploring, in case others at Mozilla are interested in instrumenting their pet internal tools or projects. If this effort is successful, I&rsquo;ll distill these notes into a tutorial in the Glean documentation.</p>

<h2 id="initial-steps-defining-pings-and-metrics">Initial steps: defining pings and metrics</h2>

<p>The initial step in setting up a Glean project of any type is to define explicitly the types of pings and metrics. You can look at a &ldquo;ping&rdquo; as being a small bucket of data submitted by a piece of software in the field. A &ldquo;metric&rdquo; is something we&rsquo;re measuring and including in a ping.</p>

<p>Most of the Glean documentation focuses on browser-based use-cases where we might want to sample lots of different things on an ongoing basis, but for mozregression our needs are considerably simpler: we just want to know when someone <em>has</em> used it along with a small number of non-personally identifiable characteristics of their usage, e.g. the mozregression version number and the name of the application they are bisecting.</p>

<p>Glean has <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/events.html">the concept of event pings</a>, but it seems like those are there more for a fine-grained view of what&rsquo;s going on during an application&rsquo;s use. So let&rsquo;s define a new ping just for ourselves, giving it the unimaginative name &ldquo;usage&rdquo;. This goes in a file called <code>pings.yaml</code>:</p>

<div class="brush: yaml">
 <div class="colorful">
  <pre><span></span><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nt">$schema</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">moz://mozilla.org/schemas/glean/pings/1-0-0</span>

<span class="nt">usage</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">description</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">&gt;</span>
    <span class="no">A ping to record usage of mozregression</span>
  <span class="nt">include_client_id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
  <span class="nt">notification_emails</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">wlachance@mozilla.com</span>
  <span class="nt">bugs</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/123456789/</span>
  <span class="nt">data_reviews</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">http://example.com/path/to/data-review</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>We also need to define a list of things we want to measure. To start with, let&rsquo;s just test with one piece of sample information: the app we&rsquo;re bisecting (e.g. &ldquo;Firefox&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gecko View Example&rdquo;). This goes in a file called <code>metrics.yaml</code>:</p>

<div class="brush: yaml">
 <div class="colorful">
  <pre><span></span><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="nt">$schema</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">moz://mozilla.org/schemas/glean/metrics/1-0-0</span>

<span class="nt">usage</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">app</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">string</span>
    <span class="nt">description</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">&gt;</span>
      <span class="no">The name of the app being bisected</span>
    <span class="nt">notification_emails</span><span class="p">:</span> 
      <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">wlachance@mozilla.com</span>
    <span class="nt">bugs</span><span class="p">:</span> 
      <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581647</span>
    <span class="nt">data_reviews</span><span class="p">:</span> 
      <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">http://example.com/path/to/data-review</span>
    <span class="nt">expires</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">never</span>
    <span class="nt">send_in_pings</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">usage</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The <code>data_reviews</code> sections in both of the above are obviously bogus, we will need to actually get data review before landing and using this code, to make sure that we&rsquo;re in conformance with Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection">data collection policies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="testing-it-out">Testing it out</h2>

<p>But in the mean time, we can test our setup with the <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/debug_ping_view.html">Glean debug pings viewer</a> by setting a special tag (<code>mozregression-test-tag</code>) on our output. Here&rsquo;s a small python script which does just that:</p>

<p>Running this script on my laptop, I see that a respectable JSON payload was delivered to and processed by our servers:</p>

<p><img style="width:600px" src="/files/2020/02/glean-debug-ping-viewer.png" /></p>

<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;re successfully processing both the &ldquo;version&rdquo; number of mozregression, some characteristics of the machine sending the information (my MacBook in this case), as well as our single measure. We also have a client id, which should tell us roughly how many distinct installations of mozregression are sending pings. This should be more than sufficient for an initial &ldquo;mozregression usage dashboard&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of things I still need to work through before landing this inside mozregression itself. Notably, the Glean python bindings are python3-only, so we&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426766">port the mozregression GUI to python 3</a> before we can start measuring usage there. But I&rsquo;m excited at how quickly this work is coming together: stay tuned for part 2 in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Lately the data engineering team has been looking into productionizing (i.e. running in Airflow) a bunch of models that the data science team has been producing. This often involves languages and environments that are a bit outside of our comfort zone &mdash; for example, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/missioncontrol-v2">the next version of Mission Control</a> relies on the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan">R-stan library</a> to produce a model of expected crash behaviour as Firefox is released.</p>

<p>To make things as simple and deterministic as possible, we&rsquo;ve been building up Docker containers to run/execute this code along with their dependencies, which makes things nice and reproducible. My initial thought was to use just the language-native toolchains to build up my container for the above project, but quickly found a number of problems:</p>

<ol>
 <li>For local testing, Docker on Mac is <em>slow</em>: when doing a large number of statistical calculations (as above), you can count on your testing iterations taking 3 to 4 (or more) times longer.</li>
 <li>On initial setup, the default R packaging strategy is to have the user of a package like R-stan recompile from source. This can take <em>forever</em> if you have a long list of dependencies with C-compiled extensions (pretty much a given if you&rsquo;re working in the data space): rebuilding my initial docker environment for missioncontrol-v2 took almost an hour. This isn&rsquo;t just a problem for local development: it also makes continuous integration using a service like Circle or Travis expensive and painful.</li></ol>

<p>I had been vaguely aware of <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">Conda</a> for a few years, but didn&rsquo;t really understand its value proposition until I started working on the above project: why bother with a heavyweight package manager when you already have Docker to virtualize things? The answer is that it solves both of the above problems: for local development, you can get something more-or-less identical to what you&rsquo;re running inside Docker with no performance penalty whatsoever. And for building the docker container itself, Conda&rsquo;s package repository contains pre-compiled versions of all the dependencies you&rsquo;d want to use for something like this (even somewhat esoteric libraries like R-stan are available on <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a>), which brought my build cycle times down to less than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>tl;dr: If you have a bunch of R / python code you want to run in a reproducible manner, consider Conda.</p>

<p>For the last year, we&rsquo;ve been gradually migrating our backend Telemetry systems from AWS to GCP. I&rsquo;ve been helping out here and there with this effort, most recently porting a job we used to detect slow tab spinners in Firefox nightly, which produced a small dataset that feeds a <a href="https://mikeconley.github.io/bug1310250/">small adhoc dashboard</a> which Mike Conley maintains. This was a relatively small task as things go, but it highlighted some features and improvements which I think might be broadly interesting, so I decided to write up a small blog post about it.</p>

<p>Essentially all this dashboard tells you is what percentage of the Firefox nightly population saw a tab spinner over the past 6 months. And of those that did see a tab spinner, what was the severity? Essentially we’re just trying to make sure that there are no major regressions of user experience (and also that efforts to improve things bore fruit):</p>

<center><img style="width:600px" srcset="/files/2019/10/tab-spinner-dash.png" /></center>

<p>Pretty simple stuff, but getting the data necessary to produce this kind of dashboard used to be anything but trivial: while some common business/product questions could be answered by a quick query to <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/batch_view/clients_daily/reference.html">clients_daily</a>, getting engineering-specific metrics like this usually involved trawling through gigabytes of raw heka encoded blobs using an Apache Spark cluster and then extracting the relevant information out of the telemetry probe histograms (in this case, <code>FX_TAB_SWITCH_SPINNER_VISIBLE_MS</code> and <code>FX_TAB_SWITCH_SPINNER_VISIBLE_LONG_MS</code>) contained therein.</p>

<p>The code itself was rather complicated (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/python_mozetl/blob/58dce245ce8012b338e8b102a8c2c0f00601be60/mozetl/tab_spinner/tab_spinner.py">take a look, if you dare</a>) but even worse, running it could get <em>very expensive</em>. We had a 14 node cluster churning through this script daily, and it took on average about an hour and a half to run! I don&rsquo;t have the exact cost figures on hand (and am not sure if I&rsquo;d be authorized to share them if I did), but based on a back of the envelope sketch, this one single script was probably costing us somewhere on the order of $10-$40 a day (that works out to between $3650-$14600 a year).</p>

<p>With our move to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>, things get a lot simpler! Thanks to the combined effort of my team and data operations[1], we now produce &ldquo;stable&rdquo; ping tables on a daily basis with <em>all</em> the relevant histogram data (stored as JSON blobs), queryable using relatively vanilla SQL. In this case, the data we care about is in <code>telemetry.main</code> (named after the main ping, appropriately enough). With the help of a small <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions">JavaScript UDF</a> function, all of this data can easily be extracted into a table inside a single SQL query scheduled by <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html">sql.telemetry.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to being much simpler, this new job is also <em>way</em> cheaper. The last run of it scanned just over 1 TB of data, meaning it cost us just over $5. Not as cheap as I might like, but considerably less expensive than before: I&rsquo;ve also scheduled it to only run once every other day, since Mike tells me he doesn&rsquo;t need this data any more often than that.</p>

<p>Just a note that I&rsquo;ve decided to step back from <a href="https://metricsgraphicsjs.org">metrics graphics</a> maintenance for the time being, which means that the project is essentially unowned. This has sort of been the case for a while, but I figured I should probably make it official.</p>

<p>If you follow the link to the <a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/">metrics graphics repository</a>, you&rsquo;ll note that the version has been bumped to &ldquo;3.0-alpha3&rdquo;. I was <em>this close</em> to making one last new release this afternoon but decided I didn&rsquo;t want to potentially break existing users who were fine using the last &ldquo;official&rdquo; version (v3.0 bumps the version of d3 used to &ldquo;5&rdquo;, among other breaking changes). I&rsquo;d encourage people who want to continue using the library to make a fork and publish a copy under their user or organization name on npm.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2019/09/mozregression-update-python-3-edition/">mozregression update: python 3 edition</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">Sep 16th, 2019</p>
    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/mozregression.html">mozregression</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>For those who are still wondering, yup, I am still maintaining <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/">mozregression</a>, though increasingly reluctantly. Given how important this project is to the development of Firefox (getting a regression window using mozregression is standard operating procedure whenever a new bug is reported in Firefox), it feels like this project is pretty vital, so I continue out of some sense of obligation &mdash; but really, someone more interested in Mozilla&rsquo;a build, automation and testing systems would be better suited to this task: over the past few years, my interests/focus have shifted away from this area to building up Mozilla&rsquo;s data storage and visualization platform.</p>

<p>This post will describe some of the things that have happened in the last year and where I see the project going. My hope is to attract some new blood to add some needed features to the project and maybe take on some of the maintainership duties.</p>

<h2 id="python-3">python 3</h2>

<p>The most important update is that, as of today, the command-line version of mozregression (v3.0.1) should work with python 3.5+. <a href="https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">modernize</a> did most of the work for us, though there were some unit tests that needed updating: special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gloomy-ghost">@gloomy-ghost</a> for helping with that.</p>

<p>For now, we will continue to support python 2.7 in parallel, mainly because the GUI has not yet been ported to python 3 (more on that later) and we have CI to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t break.</p>

<h2 id="other-updates">other updates</h2>

<p>The last year has mostly been one of maintenance. Thanks in particular to Ian Moody (:kwan) for his work throughout the year &mdash; including patches to adapt mozregression support to our new updates policy and shippable builds (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532412">bug 1532412</a>), and Kartikaya Gupta (:kats) for adding support for bisecting the GeckoView example app (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1507225">bug 1507225</a>).</p>

<h2 id="future-work">future work</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of things I see us wanting to add or change with mozregression over the next year or so. I might get to some of these if I have some spare cycles, but probably best not to count on it:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Port the mozregression GUI to Python 3 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581633">bug  1581633</a>) As mentioned  above, the command-line client works with python 3, but we have yet to port  the <a href="">GUI</a>. We should do that. This probably also entails porting the GUI to  use PyQT5 (which is pip-installable and thus much easier to integrate into a  CI process), see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426766">bug 1426766</a>.</li>
 <li>Make self-contained GUI builds available for MacOS X (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425105">bug  1425105</a>) and Linux  (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581643">bug 1581643</a>).</li>
 <li>Improve our mechanism for producing a standalone version of the GUI in  general. We&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/anthony-tuininga/cx_Freeze">cx_Freeze</a>  which mostly works ok, but has a number of problems (e.g. it pulls in a bunch of unnecessary dependencies, which  bloats the size of the installer). Upgrading the GUI to use python 3 may  alleviate some of these issues, but it might be worth considering other  options in this space, like Gregory Szorc&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">pyoxidizer</a>.</li>
 <li>Add some kind of telemetry to mozregression to measure usage of this tool  (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581647">bug 1581647</a>).  My anecdotal experience is that this tool is pretty invaluable for Firefox  development and QA, but this is not immediately apparent to Mozilla&rsquo;s  leadership and it&rsquo;s thus very difficult to convince people to spend their  cycles on maintaining and improving this tool. Field data may help change  that story.</li>
 <li>Supporting new Mozilla products which aren&rsquo;t built (entirely) out of mozilla-central,  most especially Fenix (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556042">bug 1556042</a>)  and Firefox Reality (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568488">bug 1568488</a>).  This is probably rather involved (mozregression has a big pile of assumptions about how  the builds it pulls down are stored and organized) but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that  this work isn&rsquo;t necessary.</li></ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in working on any of the above, please feel free to dive in on one of the above bugs. I can&rsquo;t offer formal mentorship, but am happy to help out where I can.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit bad about updating this blog over the past year or so, though this hasn&rsquo;t meant there haven&rsquo;t been things to talk about. For the next couple weeks, I&rsquo;m going to try to give some updates on the projects I have been spending time on in the past year, both old and new. I&rsquo;m going to begin with some of the less-loved things I&rsquo;ve been working on, partially in an attempt to motivate some forward-motion on things that I believe are rather important to Mozilla.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/Iodide.html">Iodide</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>Last week, Brendan Colloran <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/">announced Iodide</a>, a new take on scientific collaboration and reporting that I&rsquo;ve been really happy to contribute to over the past year-and-a-bit. I&rsquo;ve been describing it to people I meet as kind of "<a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a> meets <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> " but that doesn&rsquo;t quite do it justice. I&rsquo;d recommend reading Brendan&rsquo;s blog post (and taking a look at our <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io">demonstration site</a>) to get the full picture.</p>

<p>One question that I&rsquo;ve heard asked (including on Brendan&rsquo;s post) is why we chose a rather conventional and old technology (<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) for the server backend. Certainly, Iodide has not been shy about building with relatively new or experimental technologies for other parts (e.g. Python on WebAssembly for the notebooks, React/Redux for the frontend). Why not complete the cycle by using a new-fangled JavaScript web server like, I don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>? And while we&rsquo;re at it, what&rsquo;s with iodide&rsquo;s ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a>? Don&rsquo;t you know <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is the only legitimate way to expose your backend to the world in 2019?</p>

<p>The great urban theorist of the twentieth century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> has a quote I love:</p>

<p>
 <i>“Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.”</i></p>

<p>Laura Thompson (an engineering director at Mozilla) has restated this wisdom in a software development context as <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lauraxt/build-exciting-things-with-boring-technologies">&ldquo;Build exciting things with boring technologies&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It so happened that the server was not an area Iodide was focusing on for innovation (at least initially), so it made much, much more sense to use something proven and battle-tested for the server side deployment. I&rsquo;d used Django for a number of projects at Mozilla before this one (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder">Treeherder/Perfherder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/missioncontrol/">Mission Control</a>) and have been wildly impressed by the project&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/">database access layer</a>, and support for building a standardized API via the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a> add-on. Not to mention the fact that so much of Mozilla&rsquo;s in-house ops and web development expertise is based around this framework (I could name off probably 5 or 6 internal business systems based around the Django stack, in addition to Treeherder), so deploying Iodide and getting help building it would be something of a known quantity.</p>

<p>Only slightly more than half a year since I began work on the iodide server, we now have both a publicly accessible site for others to experiment with <em>and</em> an internal one for Mozilla&rsquo;s business needs. It&rsquo;s hard to say what would have happened had I chosen something more experimental to build Iodide&rsquo;s server piece, but at the very least there would have been a substantial learning curve involved &mdash; in addition to engineering effort to fill in the gaps where the new technology is not yet complete &mdash; which would have meant less time to innovate where it really mattered. Django&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/">database migration system</a>, for example, took years to come to fruition and I&rsquo;m not aware of anything comparable in the world of JavaScript web frameworks.</p>

<p>As we move ahead, we may find places where applying new backend server technologies makes sense. Heck, maybe we&rsquo;ll chose to rewrite the whole thing at some point. But to get to launch, chosing a bunch of boring, tested software for this portion of Iodide was (in my view) absolutely the right decision and I make no apologies for it.</p>
