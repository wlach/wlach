<p>Just wanted to talk about some recent performance improvements we&rsquo;ve made recently to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Treeherder">Treeherder</a>:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1311511">Bug 1311511</a>: Changed the repository endpoint so we don&rsquo;t do 40 redundant database  queries (this was generally innocuous, but could delay loading by  400ms if the database was under heavy load).</li>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310016">Bug 1310016</a>: Persisted database connections across requests (this  can save ~40&ndash;50ms per request, of which there can be 5&ndash;10  when loading a Treeherder page).</li>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308782">Bug 1308782</a>: <em>Don&rsquo;t</em> download job type and group information  from the server to get a &ldquo;sorting order&rdquo; for the job lists. This was  never necessary, but it&rsquo;s gotten exponentially more painful as  people have added job types to Treeherder (job type information is  now around a megabyte of JSON these days). This saves 5&ndash;10 seconds on a  typical page load.</li></ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come, but with these changes Treeherder should be faster for everyone to load. It should be particularly noticeable on try pushes, where the last item was by far the largest bottleneck. Here&rsquo;s a youtube video of the changes:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNJGoZhA4Vs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>The original is on the left. The newer, faster Treeherder is on the right. Pay particular attention to how much faster the job information populates.</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Optimization can be helpful, but it&rsquo;s better if you can avoid doing the work altogether.</p>

<p>For every commit to Firefox, we run a battery of builds and automated tests on the resulting source tree to make sure that the result still works and meets our correctness and performance quality criteria. This is expensive: every new push to our repository implies hundreds of hours of machine time. However, automated quality control is essential to ensure that the product that we&rsquo;re shipping to users is something that we can be proud of.</p>

<p>But what about evaluating the quality of the product which does the building and testing? Who does that? And by what criteria would we say that our automation system is good or bad? Up to now, our procedures for this have been rather embarassingly adhoc. With some exceptions (such as <a href="https://brasstacks.mozilla.com/orangefactor/">OrangeFactor</a>), our QA process amounts to motivated engineers doing a one-off analysis of a particular piece of the system, filing a few bugs, then forgetting about it. Occasionally someone will propose turning build and test automation for a specific platform on or off in mozilla.dev.planning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to suggest that the time has come to take a more systemic approach to this class of problem. We spend a lot of money on people and machines to maintain this infrastructure, and I think we need a more disciplined approach to make sure that we are getting good value for that investment.</p>

<p>As a starting point, I feel like we need to pay closer attention to the following characteristics of our automation:</p>

<ul>
 <li>End-to-end times from push submission to full completion of all  build and test jobs: if this gets too long, it makes the lives  of all sorts of people painful &mdash; tree closures become longer when  they happen (because it takes longer to either notice bustage or  find out that it&rsquo;s fixed), developers have to wait longer for  try pushes (making them more likely to just push directly to an  integration branch, causing the former problem&hellip;)</li>
 <li>Number of machine hours consumed by the different types of test  jobs: our resources are large (relatively speaking), but not  unlimited. We need proper accounting of where we&rsquo;re spending money  and time. In some cases, resources used to perform a task that  we don&rsquo;t care that much about could be redeployed towards an  underresourced task that we do care about. A good example of this  was linux32 talos (performance tests) last year: when the question  was raised of why we were doing performance testing on this specific  platform (in addition to Linux64), no one could come up with a great  justification. So we turned the tests off and reconfigured the machines  to do Windows performance tests (where we were suffering from a severe  lack of capacity).</li></ul>

<p>Over the past week, I&rsquo;ve been prototyping a project I&rsquo;ve been calling &ldquo;Infraherder&rdquo; which uses the data inside <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org">Treeherder</a>&rsquo;s job database to try to answer these questions (and maybe some others that I haven&rsquo;t thought of yet). You can see a hacky version of it on <a href="http://wlach.github.io/treeherder/ui/infra.html#/last-finished">my github fork</a>.</p>

<p>Why implement this in Treeherder you might ask? Two reasons. First, Treeherder already stores the job data in a historical archive that&rsquo;s easy to query (using SQL). Using this directly makes sense over creating a new data store. Second, Treeherder provides a useful set of front-end components with which to build a UI with which to visualize this information. I actually did my initial prototyping inside an ipython notebook, but it quickly became obvious that for my results to be useful to others at Mozilla we needed some kind of real dashboard that people could dig into.</p>

<p>On the Treeherder team at Mozilla, we&rsquo;ve found the <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> software to be invaluable for diagnosing and fixing quality and performance problems for Treeherder itself, so I took some inspiration from it (unfortunately the problem space of our automation is not quite the same as that of a web application, so we can&rsquo;t just use New Relic directly).</p>

<p>There are currently two views in the prototype, a &ldquo;last finished&rdquo; view and a &ldquo;total&rdquo; view. I&rsquo;ll describe each of them in turn.</p>

<h3 id="last-finished">Last finished</h3>

<p>This view shows the counts of which scheduled automation jobs were the &ldquo;last&rdquo; to finish. The hypothesis is that jobs that are frequently last indicate blockers to developer productivity, as they are the &ldquo;long pole&rdquo; in being able to determine if a push is good or bad.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-last-finished.png" width="500px" /></p>

<p>Right away from this view, you can see the mochitest devtools 9 test is often the last to finish on try, with Windows 7 mochitest debug a close second. Assuming that the reasons for this are not resource starvation (they don&rsquo;t appear to be), we could probably get results into the hands of developers and sheriffs faster if we split these jobs into two seperate ones. I filed bugs <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294489">1294489</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294706">1294706</a> to address these issues.</p>

<h3 id="total-time">Total Time</h3>

<p>This view just shows which jobs are taking up the most machine hours.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-total.png" width="500px" /></p>

<p>Probably unsurprisingly, it seems like it&rsquo;s Android test jobs that are taking up most of the time here: these tests are running on multiple layers of emulation (AWS instances to emulate Linux hardware, then the already slow QEMU-based Android simulator) so are not expected to have fast runtime. I wonder if it might not be worth considering running these tests on faster instances and/or bare metal machines.</p>

<p>Linux32 debug tests seem to be another large consumer of resources. Market conditions make turning these tests off altogether a non-starter (see bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255890">1255890</a>), but how much value do we really derive from running the debug version of linux32 through automation (given that we&rsquo;re already doing the same for 64-bit Linux)?</p>

<h3 id="request-for-comments">Request for comments</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SrlJQQ3qWuM0tvruG6Lr59t3hJ4XRUoMIrIRQYvwu9A/edit?usp=sharing">an RFC</a> for this project on Google Docs, as a sort of test case for a new process we&rsquo;re thinking of using in Engineering Productivity for these sorts of projects. If you have any questions or comments, I&rsquo;d love to hear them! My perspective on this vast problem space is limited, so I&rsquo;m sure there are things that I&rsquo;m missing.</p>

  </header>

<p>Following on the footsteps of Mike Ling&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2015/09/perfherder-summer-of-contribution-thoughts/">amazing work</a> on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ngineeringProductivityâ€Ž/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> in 2015 (he&rsquo;s gone on to do a GSOC project), I got two amazing contributors to continue working on the project for a few weeks this summer as part of our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution">quarter of contribution</a> program: Shruti Jasoria and Roy Chiang.</p>

<p>Shruti started by adding a feature to the treeherder/perfherder backend (ability to enable or disable a new performance framework on a tentative basis), then went on to make all sorts of improvements to the Treeherder / Perfherder frontend, fixing bugs in the performance sheriffing frontend, updating code to use more modern standards (including a gigantic patch to enable a bunch of eslint rules and fix the corresponding problems).</p>

<p>Roy worked all over the codebase, starting with some simple frontend fixes to Treeherder, moving on to fix a large number of nits in Perfherder&rsquo;s alerts view. My personal favorite is the fact that we now paginate the list of alerts inside this view, which makes navigation waaaaay back into history possible:</p>

<p><a href="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png"><img src="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png" alt="alert pagination" width="300px" /></a></p>

<p>You can see a summary of their work at these links:</p>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/commits/master?author=crosscent">Roy Chiang</a></li></ul>

<p>Thank you Shruti and Roy! You&rsquo;ve helped to make sure Firefox (and Servo!) performance remains top-notch.</p>

<p>Just wanted to announce that, once again, my team (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity">Mozilla Engineering Productivity</a>) is just about to start running another <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution">quarter of contribution</a> &mdash; a great opportunity for newer community members to dive deep on some of the projects we&rsquo;re working on, brush up on their programming and problem solving skills, and work with experienced mentors. You can find more information on this program <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Summer_2016">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found this program to be a really great experience on both sides &mdash; it&rsquo;s an opportunity for contributors to really go beyond the &ldquo;good first bug&rdquo; style of patches to having a really substantial impact on some of the projects that we&rsquo;re working on while gaining lots of software development skills that are useful in the real world.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m going to be mentoring one or two people on the Perfherder project, a tool we use to measure and sheriff Firefox performance. If you&rsquo;re inclined to work on some really interesting data analysis and user interface problems in Python and JavaScript, please have a look at the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Perfherder">project page</a> and get in touch. :)</p>

    <p class='index-date'><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time" aria-hidden="true"></span> Mar 30th, 2016</p>
  </header>

<p>Historically at Mozilla, we&rsquo;ve had a bunch of different systems running to benchmark Firefox&rsquo;s performance. The two most broadly-scoped are <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos">Talos</a> (which runs as part of our build process, and emphasizes common real-world use cases, like page loading) and <a href="https://arewefastyet.com/">Are We Fast Yet</a> (which runs seperately, and emphasizes JavaScript performance and benchmarks).</p>

<p>As many of you know, most of my focus over the last year-and-a-bit has been developing a system called Perfherder, which aims to make monitoring and acting on performance data easier. A great introduction to Perfherder is my <a href="/blog/2016/03/platform-engineering-project-of-the-month-perfherder/">project of the month post</a>.</p>

<p>The initial focus of Perfherder has been Talos, which is deeply integrated into our automation and also maintained by Engineering Productivity (my group). However, the intention was always to allow anyone in the Mozilla community to submit performance data for Firefox and sheriff it, much like Treeherder has supported the submission of test result data from third parties (e.g. autophone, Firefox UI tests). There are more commonalities than differences in how we do performance sheriffing with Are We Fast Yet (which currently has its own web interface) and Perfherder, so it made sense to see if we could pool resources.</p>

<p>So, over the last couple of months, <a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/">Joel Maher</a> and I have been in discussions with Hannes Verschore, current maintainer of Are We Fast Yet (AWFY) to see what could be done. It looks like it is possible for Perfherder to provide most of what AWFY needs, though there are a few exceptions. I thought for the benefit of others, it might be useful to outline what&rsquo;s done, what&rsquo;s coming next, and what might not be implemented (at least not any time soon).</p>

<h3 id="whats-done">What&rsquo;s done</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Get AWFY submitting data to Perfherder and allow it to be sheriffed  seperately from Talos. This is working on treeherder stage, and you  can already examine the <a href="https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html#/alerts?status=0&amp;framework=5">alert data</a>.</li></ul>

<h3 id="whats-in-progress-or-in-the-near-term-pipeline">What&rsquo;s in progress (or in the near-term pipeline)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Allow custom alerting behaviour (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1254595">bug 1254595</a>). For example, we want  to alert on subtests for AWFY while still summarizing the results.  This is something we don&rsquo;t currently support.</li>
 <li>Allow creating an alert manually (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260791">bug 1260791</a>). Sadly, our regression detection  algorithm is not perfect. AWFY already supports this, we should too. This is something we also want for Talos.</li>
 <li>Make regression-filing templates non-talos-specific (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260805">bug 1260805</a>). Currently we have a convenience template for filing bugs for performance  regressions, but this is currently specific to various things about Talos (job running instructions, links to documentation, etc.). We should  make it configurable so other projects like AWFY can take advantage of this functionality.</li></ul>

<h3 id="under-consideration">Under consideration</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Some kind of support for bisecting a push to figure out which patch  caused a regression. AWFY currently supports this, but it&rsquo;s a fairly  difficult thing to add to Perfherder (much of which is built upon  Treeherder&rsquo;s per-push result model). Maybe this is something we should  do, but it would be a significant amount of effort.</li>
 <li>Proprietary benchmarks: AWFY runs one benchmark the results for  which we can&rsquo;t make public. Adding &ldquo;private&rdquo; jobs or results to  Treeherder is likely a big can of worms, but it might be something  we want to do eventually.</li></ul>

<h3 id="probably-wont-fix">Probably won&rsquo;t fix</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Supporting comparative measurements between Firefox and other  browsers. This is an important task, but doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the  model of Perfherder, which is intimately tied to the revision data  associated with Firefox. To do this would require detailed tracking  of Chrome on the same basis, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really a place  where we want to go. We should definitely monitor for general  trends, but I think that is best done with a seperate system.</li></ul>

<p><em>[ originally posted on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/itdfru6csSk/vfVP_WDXBgAJ">mozilla.dev.platform</a> ]</em></p>

<p>Hello from Platform Engineering Operations! Once a month we highlight one of our projects to help the Mozilla community discover a useful tool or an interesting contribution opportunity.</p>

<p>This monthâ€™s project is Perfherder!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-perfherder">What is Perfherder?</h3>

<p>Perfherder is a generic system for visualizing and analyzing performance data produced by the many automated tests we run here at Mozilla (such as Talos, &ldquo;Are we fast yet?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are we slim yet?&rdquo;). The chief goal of the project is to make sure that performance of Firefox gets better, not worse over time. It does this by:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Tracking the performance generated by our automated tests, allowing  them to be visualized on a graph.</li>
 <li>Providing a sheriffing dashboard which allows for incoming  alerts of performance regressions to be annotated and triaged - bugs  can be filed based on a template and their resolution status can be  tracked.</li></ul>

<p>In addition to its own user interface, Perfherder also provides an API on the backend that other people can use to build custom performance visualizations and dashboards. For example, the metrics group has been working on a set of release quality indices for performance based on Perfherder data:</p>

<p><a href="https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/">https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/</a></p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>Perfherder is part of Treeherder, building on that project&rsquo;s existing support for tracking revision and test job information. Like the rest of Treeherder, Perfherder&rsquo;s backend is written in Python, using the Django web framework. The user interface is written as an AngularJS application.</p>

<h3 id="learning-more">Learning more</h3>

<p>For more information on Perfherder than you ever wanted to know, please see the wiki page:</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder">https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder</a></p>

<h3 id="can-i-contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>

<p>Yes! We have had some fantastic contributions from the community to Perfherder, and are always looking for more. This is a great way to help developers make Firefox faster (or use less memory). The core of Perfherder is relatively small, so this is a great chance to learn either Django or Angular if you have a small amount of Python and/or JavaScript experience.</p>

<p>We have set aside a set of bugs that are suitable for getting started here:</p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;resolution=---&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;resolution=---&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small thing, but I submitted a patch to <a href="http://trychooser.pub.build.mozilla.org/">trychooser</a> last week which adds a tooltip indicating the actual Talos tests that are run as part of the various jobs that you can schedule as part of a try push. It&rsquo;s in production as of now:</p>

<video src="/files/2016/02/talos-trychooser.webm" controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay"></video>

<p>Previously, the only way to do this was to dig into the actual buildbot code, which was more than a little annoying.</p>

<p>If you think your patch might have a good chance of regressing performance, please do run the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests">Talos tests</a> before you check in. It&rsquo;s much less work for all of us when these things are caught before integration and back outs are no fun for anyone. We really need better documentation for this stuff, but meanwhile if you need help with this, please ask in the #perf channel on irc.mozilla.org</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2015/10/the-new-old-perfherder-data-model/">database refactoring</a> I mentioned a few weeks ago, some cool stuff has been going into <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> lately.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking installer size</strong></p>

<p>Perfherder is now tracking the size of the Firefox installer for the various platforms we support (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149164">bug 1149164</a>). I originally only intended to track Android .APK size (on request from the mobile team), but installer sizes for other platforms came along for the ride. I don&#8217;t think anyone will complain.</p>

<p><a href="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM.png"><img src="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-300x181.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-03 at 5.28.48 PM" width="300" height="181" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1274" srcset="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-300x181.png 300w, /files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-1024x618.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?series=[mozilla-inbound,4eb0cde5431ee9aeb5eb14512ddb3da6d4702cf0,1]&amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,80cac7ef44b76864458627c574af1a18a425f338,1]&amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,0060252bdfb7632df5877b7594b4d16f1b5ca4c9,1]">link</a></p>

<p>Just as exciting to me as the feature itself is how it&#8217;s implemented: I added a log parser to treeherder which just picks up a line called &#8220;PERFHERDER_DATA&#8221; in the logs with specially formatted JSON data, and then automatically stores whatever metrics are in there in the database (platform, options, etc. are automatically determined). For example, on Linux:</p>

<pre><code>PERFHERDER_DATA: {"framework": {"name": "build_metrics"}, "suites": [{"subtests": [{"name": "libxul.so", "value": 99030741}], "name": "installer size", "value": 55555785}]}</code></pre>

<p>This should make it super easy for people to add their own metrics to Perfherder for build and test jobs. We&#8217;ll have to be somewhat careful about how we do this (we don&#8217;t want to add thousands of new series with irrelevant / inconsistent data) but I think there&#8217;s lots of potential here to be able to track things we care about on a per-commit basis. Maybe build times (?).</p>

<p><strong>More compare view improvements</strong></p>

<p>I added filtering to the Perfherder compare view and added back links to the graphs view. Filtering should make it easier to highlight particular problematic tests in bug reports, etc. The graphs links shouldn&#8217;t really be necessary, but unfortunately are due to the unreliability of our data &#8212; sometimes you can only see if a particular difference between two revisions is worth paying attention to in the context of the numbers over the last several weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>

<p>Even after the <a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2015/09/perfherder-summer-of-contribution-thoughts/">summer of contribution</a> has ended, Mike Ling continues to do great work. Looking at the commit log over the past few weeks, he&#8217;s been responsible for the following fixes and improvements:</p>

<p><strong>Next up</strong></p>

<p>My main goal for this quarter is to create a fully functional interface for actually sheriffing performance regressions, to replace <a href="http://alertmanager.allizom.org:8080/alerts.html">alertmanager</a>. Work on this has been going well. More soon.</p>

    <p class='index-date'><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time" aria-hidden="true"></span> Oct 23rd, 2015</p>
  </header>

<p>I spent a good chunk of time last quarter redesigning how <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> stores its data internally. Here are some notes on this change, for posterity.</p>

<p>Perfherder&#8217;s data model is based around two concepts:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Series signatures: A unique set of properties (platform, test name, suite name, options) that identifies a performance test.</li>
 <li>Series data: A set of measurements for a series signature, indexed by treeherder push and job information.</li></ol>

<p>When it was first written, Perfherder stored the second type of data as a JSON-encoded series in a relational (MySQL) database. That is, instead of storing each datum as a row in the database, we would store sequences of them. The assumption was that for the common case (getting a bunch of data to plot on a graph), this would be faster than fetching a bunch of rows and then encoding them as JSON. Unfortunately this wasn&#8217;t really true, and it had some serious drawbacks besides.</p>

<p>First, the approach&#8217;s performance was awful when it came time to add new data. To avoid needing to decode or download the full stored series when you wanted to render only a small subset of it, we stored the same series multiple times over various time intervals. For example, we stored the series data for one day, one week&#8230; all the way up to one year. You can probably see the problem already: you have to decode and re-encode the same data structure many times for each time interval for every new performance datum you were inserting into the database. The pseudo code looked something like this for each push:</p>

<pre><code>for each platform we're testing talos on:
  for each talos job for the platform:
    for each test suite in the talos job:
      for each subtest in the test suite:
        for each time interval in one year, 90 days, 60 days, ...:
           fetch and decode json series for that time interval from db
           add datapoint to end of series
           re-encode series as json and store in db</code></pre>

<p>Consider that we have some 6 platforms (android, linux64, osx, winxp, win7, win8), 20ish test suites with potentially dozens of subtests&#8230; and you can see where the problems begin.</p>

<p>In addition to being slow to write, this was also a pig in terms of disk space consumption. The overhead of JSON (&#8220;{, }&#8221; characters, object properties) really starts to add up when you&#8217;re storing millions of performance measurements. We got around this (sort of) by gzipping the contents of these series, but that still left us with gigantic mysql replay logs as we stored the complete &#8220;transaction&#8221; of replacing each of these series rows thousands of times per day. At one point, we completely ran out of disk space on the treeherder staging instance due to this issue.</p>

<p>Read performance was also often terrible for many common use cases. The original assumption I mentioned above was wrong: rendering points on a graph is only one use case a system like Perfherder has to handle. We also want to be able to get the set of series values associated with two result sets (to render comparison views) or to look up the data associated with a particular job. We were essentially indexing the performance data only on one single dimension (time) which made these other types of operations unnecessarily complex and slow &#8212; especially as the data you want to look up ages. For example, to look up a two week old comparison between two pushes, you&#8217;d also have to fetch the data for <em>every</em> subsequent push. That&#8217;s a lot of unnecessary overhead when you&#8217;re rendering a comparison view with 100 or so different performance tests:</p>

<p><a href="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png"><img src="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-08-07 at 1.57.39 PM" width="300" height="178" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1229" srcset="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png 300w, /files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the alternative? It&#8217;s actually the most obvious thing: just encode one database row per performance series value and create indexes on each of the properties that we might want to search on (repository, timestamp, job id, push id). Yes, this is a lot of rows (the new database stands at 48 million rows of performance data, and counting) but you know what? MySQL is <em>designed</em> to handle that sort of load. The current performance data table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>+----------------+------------------+
| Field          | Type             |
+----------------+------------------+
| id             | int(11)          |
| job_id         | int(10) unsigned |
| result_set_id  | int(10) unsigned |
| value          | double           |
| push_timestamp | datetime(6)      |
| repository_id  | int(11)          | 
| signature_id   | int(11)          | 
+----------------+------------------+</code></pre>

<p>MySQL can store each of these structures very efficiently, I haven&#8217;t done the exact calculations, but this is well under 50 bytes per row. Including indexes, the complete set of performance data going back to last year clocks in at 15 gigs. Not bad. And we can examine this data structure across any combination of dimensions we like (push, job, timestamp, repository) making common queries to perfherder very fast.</p>

<p>What about the initial assumption, that it would be faster to get a series out of the database if it&#8217;s already pre-encoded? Nope, not really. If you have a good index and you&#8217;re only fetching the data you need, the overhead of encoding a bunch of database rows to JSON is pretty minor. From my (remote) location in Toronto, I can fetch 30 days of <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?timerange=2592000&amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,c233ba1133abbd544002dfbc29d9e63ced42a20e,1]">tcheck2 data</a> in 250 ms. Almost certainly most of that is network latency. If the original implementation was faster, it&#8217;s not by a significant amount.</p>

<p><a href="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM.png"><img src="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-300x188.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-10-23 at 1.55.09 PM" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1259" srcset="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-300x188.png 300w, /files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-1024x643.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

  </header>

<p>A few months ago, Joel Maher <a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/a-team-contribution-opportunity-dashboard-hacker/">announced the Perfherder summer of contribution</a>. We wrapped things up there a few weeks ago, so I guess it&#8217;s about time I wrote up a bit about how things went.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the idea of summer of contribution was to give a set of contributors the opportunity to make a substantial contribution to a project we were working on (in this case, the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> performance sheriffing system). We would ask that they sign up to do 5&ndash;10 hours of work a week for at least 8 weeks. In return, Joel and myself would make ourselves available as mentors to answer questions about the project whenever they ran into trouble.</p>

<p>To get things rolling, I split off a bunch of work that we felt would be reasonable to do by a contributor into bugs of varying difficulty levels (assigning them the bugzilla whiteboard tag <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=%20ateam-summer-of-contribution&amp;#038;keywords_type=allwords&amp;#038;list_id=12578272&amp;#038;resolution=---&amp;#038;resolution=FIXED&amp;#038;resolution=INVALID&amp;#038;resolution=WONTFIX&amp;#038;resolution=DUPLICATE&amp;#038;resolution=WORKSFORME&amp;#038;resolution=INCOMPLETE&amp;#038;resolution=SUPPORT&amp;#038;resolution=EXPIRED&amp;#038;resolution=MOVED&amp;#038;query_format=advanced&amp;#038;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;#038;bug_status=NEW&amp;#038;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;#038;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;#038;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;#038;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;#038;bug_status=CLOSED">ateam-summer-of-contribution</a>). When someone first expressed interest in working on the project, I&#8217;d assign them a relatively easy front end one, just to cover the basics of working with the project (checking out code, making a change, submitting a PR to github). If they made it through that, I&#8217;d go on to assign them slightly harder or more complex tasks which dealt with other parts of the codebase, the nature of which depended on what they wanted to learn more about. Perfherder essentially has two components: a data storage and analysis backend written in Python and Django, and a web-based frontend written in JS and Angular. There was (still is) lots to do on both, which gave contributors lots of choice.</p>

<p>This system worked pretty well for attracting people. I think we got at least 5 people interested and contributing useful patches within the first couple of weeks. In general I think onboarding went well. Having good documentation for Perfherder / Treeherder on the wiki certainly helped. We had lots of the usual problems getting people familiar with git and submitting proper pull requests: we use a somewhat clumsy combination of bugzilla and github to manage treeherder issues (we &#8220;attach&#8221; PRs to bugs as plaintext), which can be a bit offputting to newcomers. But once they got past these issues, things went relatively smoothly.</p>

<p>A few weeks in, I set up a fortnightly skype call for people to join and update status and ask questions. This proved to be quite useful: it let me and Joel articulate the higher-level vision for the project to people (which can be difficult to summarize in text) but more importantly it was also a great opportunity for people to ask questions and raise concerns about the project in a free-form, high-bandwidth environment. In general I&#8217;m not a big fan of meetings (especially status report meetings) but I think these were pretty useful. Being able to hear someone else&#8217;s voice definitely goes a long way to establishing trust that you just can&#8217;t get in the same way over email and irc.</p>

<p>I think our biggest challenge was retention. Due to (understandable) time commitments and constraints only one person (Mike Ling) was really able to stick with it until the end. Still, I&#8217;m pretty happy with that success rate: if you stop and think about it, even a 10-hour a week time investment is a fair bit to ask. Some of the people who didn&#8217;t quite make it were quite awesome, I hope they come back some day.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>On that note, a special thanks to Mike Ling for sticking with us this long (he&#8217;s still around and doing useful things long after the program ended). He&#8217;s done <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/commits/master?author=MikeLing">some really fantastic work</a> inside Perfherder and the project is much better for it. I think my two favorite features that he wrote up are the improved test chooser which I talked about a few months ago and a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1134780">get related platform / branch</a> feature which is a big time saver when trying to determine when a performance regression was first introduced.</p>

<p>I took the time to do a short email interview with him last week. Here&#8217;s what he had to say:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Tell us a little bit about yourself. Where do you live? What is it you do when not contributing to Perfherder?</li></ol>

<p><em>I&#8217;m a postgraduate student of NanChang HangKong university in China whose major is Internet of things. Actually,there are a lot of things I would like to do when I am AFK, play basketball, video game, reading books and listening music, just name it ; )</em></p>

<ol>
 <li>How did you find out about the ateam summer of contribution program?</li></ol>

<p><em>well, I remember when I still a new comer of treeherder, I totally don&#8217;t know how to start my contribution. So, I just go to treeherder irc and ask for advice. As I recall, emorley and jfrench talk with me and give me a lot of hits. Then Will (wlach) send me an Email about ateam summer of contribution and perfherder. He told me it&#8217;s a good opportunity to learn more about treeherder and how to work like a team! I almost jump out of bed (I receive that email just before get asleep) and reply with YES. Thank you Will!</em></p>

<ol>
 <li>What did you find most challenging in the summer of contribution?</li></ol>

<p><em>I think the most challenging thing is I not only need to know how to code but also need to know how treeherder actually work. It&#8217;s a awesome project and there are a ton of things I haven&#8217;t heard before (i.e T-test, regression). So I still have a long way to go before I familiar with it.</em></p>

<ol>
 <li>What advice would give you to future ateam contributors?</li></ol>

<p><em>The only thing you need to do is bring your question to irc and ask. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you need it! All the people in here are nice and willing to help. Enjoy it!</em></p>
