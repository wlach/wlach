<p>For the last year, we&rsquo;ve been gradually migrating our backend Telemetry systems from AWS to GCP. I&rsquo;ve been helping out here and there with this effort, most recently porting a job we used to detect slow tab spinners in Firefox nightly, which produced a small dataset that feeds a <a href="https://mikeconley.github.io/bug1310250/">small adhoc dashboard</a> which Mike Conley maintains. This was a relatively small task as things go, but it highlighted some features and improvements which I think might be broadly interesting, so I decided to write up a small blog post about it.</p>

<p>Essentially all this dashboard tells you is what percentage of the Firefox nightly population saw a tab spinner over the past 6 months. And of those that did see a tab spinner, what was the severity? Essentially we’re just trying to make sure that there are no major regressions of user experience (and also that efforts to improve things bore fruit):</p>

<center><img style="width:600px" srcset="/files/2019/10/tab-spinner-dash.png" /></center>

<p>Pretty simple stuff, but getting the data necessary to produce this kind of dashboard used to be anything but trivial: while some common business/product questions could be answered by a quick query to <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/batch_view/clients_daily/reference.html">clients_daily</a>, getting engineering-specific metrics like this usually involved trawling through gigabytes of raw heka encoded blobs using an Apache Spark cluster and then extracting the relevant information out of the telemetry probe histograms (in this case, <code>FX_TAB_SWITCH_SPINNER_VISIBLE_MS</code> and <code>FX_TAB_SWITCH_SPINNER_VISIBLE_LONG_MS</code>) contained therein.</p>

<p>The code itself was rather complicated (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/python_mozetl/blob/58dce245ce8012b338e8b102a8c2c0f00601be60/mozetl/tab_spinner/tab_spinner.py">take a look, if you dare</a>) but even worse, running it could get <em>very expensive</em>. We had a 14 node cluster churning through this script daily, and it took on average about an hour and a half to run! I don&rsquo;t have the exact cost figures on hand (and am not sure if I&rsquo;d be authorized to share them if I did), but based on a back of the envelope sketch, this one single script was probably costing us somewhere on the order of $10-$40 a day (that works out to between $3650-$14600 a year).</p>

<p>With our move to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>, things get a lot simpler! Thanks to the combined effort of my team and data operations[1], we now produce &ldquo;stable&rdquo; ping tables on a daily basis with <em>all</em> the relevant histogram data (stored as JSON blobs), queryable using relatively vanilla SQL. In this case, the data we care about is in <code>telemetry.main</code> (named after the main ping, appropriately enough). With the help of a small <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions">JavaScript UDF</a> function, all of this data can easily be extracted into a table inside a single SQL query scheduled by <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/stmo.html">sql.telemetry.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to being much simpler, this new job is also <em>way</em> cheaper. The last run of it scanned just over 1 TB of data, meaning it cost us just over $5. Not as cheap as I might like, but considerably less expensive than before: I&rsquo;ve also scheduled it to only run once every other day, since Mike tells me he doesn&rsquo;t need this data any more often than that.</p>

<p>[1] I understand that Jeff Klukas, Frank Bertsch, Daniel Thorn, Anthony Miyaguchi, and Wesley Dawson are the principals involved - apologies if I&rsquo;m forgetting someone.</p>

<p>Just a note that I&rsquo;ve decided to step back from <a href="https://metricsgraphicsjs.org">metrics graphics</a> maintenance for the time being, which means that the project is essentially unowned. This has sort of been the case for a while, but I figured I should probably make it official.</p>

<p>If you follow the link to the <a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/">metrics graphics repository</a>, you&rsquo;ll note that the version has been bumped to &ldquo;3.0-alpha3&rdquo;. I was <em>this close</em> to making one last new release this afternoon but decided I didn&rsquo;t want to potentially break existing users who were fine using the last &ldquo;official&rdquo; version (v3.0 bumps the version of d3 used to &ldquo;5&rdquo;, among other breaking changes). I&rsquo;d encourage people who want to continue using the library to make a fork and publish a copy under their user or organization name on npm.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2019/09/mozregression-update-python-3-edition/">mozregression update: python 3 edition</a></h2>

<p>For those who are still wondering, yup, I am still maintaining <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/">mozregression</a>, though increasingly reluctantly. Given how important this project is to the development of Firefox (getting a regression window using mozregression is standard operating procedure whenever a new bug is reported in Firefox), it feels like this project is pretty vital, so I continue out of some sense of obligation &mdash; but really, someone more interested in Mozilla&rsquo;a build, automation and testing systems would be better suited to this task: over the past few years, my interests/focus have shifted away from this area to building up Mozilla&rsquo;s data storage and visualization platform.</p>

<p>This post will describe some of the things that have happened in the last year and where I see the project going. My hope is to attract some new blood to add some needed features to the project and maybe take on some of the maintainership duties.</p>

<h2 id="python-3">python 3</h2>

<p>The most important update is that, as of today, the command-line version of mozregression (v3.0.1) should work with python 3.5+. <a href="https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">modernize</a> did most of the work for us, though there were some unit tests that needed updating: special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gloomy-ghost">@gloomy-ghost</a> for helping with that.</p>

<p>For now, we will continue to support python 2.7 in parallel, mainly because the GUI has not yet been ported to python 3 (more on that later) and we have CI to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t break.</p>

<h2 id="other-updates">other updates</h2>

<p>The last year has mostly been one of maintenance. Thanks in particular to Ian Moody (:kwan) for his work throughout the year &mdash; including patches to adapt mozregression support to our new updates policy and shippable builds (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532412">bug 1532412</a>), and Kartikaya Gupta (:kats) for adding support for bisecting the GeckoView example app (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1507225">bug 1507225</a>).</p>

<h2 id="future-work">future work</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of things I see us wanting to add or change with mozregression over the next year or so. I might get to some of these if I have some spare cycles, but probably best not to count on it:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Port the mozregression GUI to Python 3 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581633">bug  1581633</a>) As mentioned  above, the command-line client works with python 3, but we have yet to port  the <a href="">GUI</a>. We should do that. This probably also entails porting the GUI to  use PyQT5 (which is pip-installable and thus much easier to integrate into a  CI process), see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426766">bug 1426766</a>.</li>
 <li>Make self-contained GUI builds available for MacOS X (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425105">bug  1425105</a>) and Linux  (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581643">bug 1581643</a>).</li>
 <li>Improve our mechanism for producing a standalone version of the GUI in  general. We&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/anthony-tuininga/cx_Freeze">cx_Freeze</a>  which mostly works ok, but has a number of problems (e.g. it pulls in a bunch of unnecessary dependencies, which  bloats the size of the installer). Upgrading the GUI to use python 3 may  alleviate some of these issues, but it might be worth considering other  options in this space, like Gregory Szorc&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">pyoxidizer</a>.</li>
 <li>Add some kind of telemetry to mozregression to measure usage of this tool  (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1581647">bug 1581647</a>).  My anecdotal experience is that this tool is pretty invaluable for Firefox  development and QA, but this is not immediately apparent to Mozilla&rsquo;s  leadership and it&rsquo;s thus very difficult to convince people to spend their  cycles on maintaining and improving this tool. Field data may help change  that story.</li>
 <li>Supporting new Mozilla products which aren&rsquo;t built (entirely) out of mozilla-central,  most especially Fenix (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556042">bug 1556042</a>)  and Firefox Reality (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568488">bug 1568488</a>).  This is probably rather involved (mozregression has a big pile of assumptions about how  the builds it pulls down are stored and organized) but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that  this work isn&rsquo;t necessary.</li></ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in working on any of the above, please feel free to dive in on one of the above bugs. I can&rsquo;t offer formal mentorship, but am happy to help out where I can.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit bad about updating this blog over the past year or so, though this hasn&rsquo;t meant there haven&rsquo;t been things to talk about. For the next couple weeks, I&rsquo;m going to try to give some updates on the projects I have been spending time on in the past year, both old and new. I&rsquo;m going to begin with some of the less-loved things I&rsquo;ve been working on, partially in an attempt to motivate some forward-motion on things that I believe are rather important to Mozilla.</p>

    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/Iodide.html">Iodide</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>Last week, Brendan Colloran <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/iodide-an-experimental-tool-for-scientific-communicatiodide-for-scientific-communication-exploration-on-the-web/">announced Iodide</a>, a new take on scientific collaboration and reporting that I&rsquo;ve been really happy to contribute to over the past year-and-a-bit. I&rsquo;ve been describing it to people I meet as kind of "<a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a> meets <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> " but that doesn&rsquo;t quite do it justice. I&rsquo;d recommend reading Brendan&rsquo;s blog post (and taking a look at our <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io">demonstration site</a>) to get the full picture.</p>

<p>One question that I&rsquo;ve heard asked (including on Brendan&rsquo;s post) is why we chose a rather conventional and old technology (<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) for the server backend. Certainly, Iodide has not been shy about building with relatively new or experimental technologies for other parts (e.g. Python on WebAssembly for the notebooks, React/Redux for the frontend). Why not complete the cycle by using a new-fangled JavaScript web server like, I don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>? And while we&rsquo;re at it, what&rsquo;s with iodide&rsquo;s ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a>? Don&rsquo;t you know <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is the only legitimate way to expose your backend to the world in 2019?</p>

<p>The great urban theorist of the twentieth century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> has a quote I love:</p>

<p>
 <i>“Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.”</i></p>

<p>Laura Thompson (an engineering director at Mozilla) has restated this wisdom in a software development context as <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lauraxt/build-exciting-things-with-boring-technologies">&ldquo;Build exciting things with boring technologies&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It so happened that the server was not an area Iodide was focusing on for innovation (at least initially), so it made much, much more sense to use something proven and battle-tested for the server side deployment. I&rsquo;d used Django for a number of projects at Mozilla before this one (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder">Treeherder/Perfherder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/missioncontrol/">Mission Control</a>) and have been wildly impressed by the project&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/">database access layer</a>, and support for building a standardized API via the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a> add-on. Not to mention the fact that so much of Mozilla&rsquo;s in-house ops and web development expertise is based around this framework (I could name off probably 5 or 6 internal business systems based around the Django stack, in addition to Treeherder), so deploying Iodide and getting help building it would be something of a known quantity.</p>

<p>Only slightly more than half a year since I began work on the iodide server, we now have both a publicly accessible site for others to experiment with <em>and</em> an internal one for Mozilla&rsquo;s business needs. It&rsquo;s hard to say what would have happened had I chosen something more experimental to build Iodide&rsquo;s server piece, but at the very least there would have been a substantial learning curve involved &mdash; in addition to engineering effort to fill in the gaps where the new technology is not yet complete &mdash; which would have meant less time to innovate where it really mattered. Django&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/">database migration system</a>, for example, took years to come to fruition and I&rsquo;m not aware of anything comparable in the world of JavaScript web frameworks.</p>

<p>As we move ahead, we may find places where applying new backend server technologies makes sense. Heck, maybe we&rsquo;ll chose to rewrite the whole thing at some point. But to get to launch, chosing a bunch of boring, tested software for this portion of Iodide was (in my view) absolutely the right decision and I make no apologies for it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2018/11/making-contribution-work-for-firefox-tooling-and-data-projects/">Making contribution work for Firefox tooling and data projects</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">Nov 26th, 2018</p>
    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/Community.html">Community</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>One of my favorite parts about Mozilla is mentoring and working alongside third party contributors. Somewhat surprisingly since I work on internal tools, I&rsquo;ve had a fair amount of luck finding people to help work on projects within my purview: <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/mozregression">mozregression</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder">perfherder</a>, <a href="https://metricsgraphics.org">metrics graphics</a>, and others have all benefited from the contributions of people outside of Mozilla.</p>

<p>In most cases (a notable exception being metrics graphics), these have been internal-tooling projects used by others to debug, develop, or otherwise understand the behaviour of Firefox. On the face of it, none of the things I work on are exactly &ldquo;high profile cutting edge stuff&rdquo; in the way, say, Firefox or the Rust Programming Language are. So why do they bother? The exact formula varies depending on contributor, but I think it usually comes down to some combination of these two things:</p>

<ol>
 <li>A desire to learn and demonstrate competence with industry standard  tooling (the python programming language, frontend web development, backend  databases, &ldquo;big data&rdquo; technologies like Parquet, &hellip;).</li>
 <li>A desire to work with and gain recognition inside of a community of  like-minded people.</li></ol>

<p>Pretty basic, obvious stuff &mdash; there is an appeal here to basic human desires like the need for security and a sense of belonging. Once someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;in the loop&rdquo;, so to speak, generally things take care of themselves. The real challenge, I&rsquo;ve found, is getting people from the &ldquo;I am potentially interested in doing something with Mozilla internal tools&rdquo; to the stage that they are confident and competent enough to work in a reasonably self-directed way. When I was on the A-Team, we classified this transition in terms of a <a href="https://ateam-bootcamp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/curve.html">commitment curve</a>:</p>

<p><img srcset="/files/2018/11/commitment-curve-visualization.png 2x" /></p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1080119">prototype commitment curve graphic by Steven Brown</a></p>

<p>The hardest part, in my experience, is the initial part of that curve. At this point, people are just dipping their toe in the water. Some may not have a ton of experience with software development yet. In other cases, my projects may just not be the right fit for them. But of course, sometimes there is a fit, or at least one could be developed! What I&rsquo;ve found most helpful is &ldquo;clearing a viable path&rdquo; forward for the right kind of contributor. That is, some kind of initial hypothesis of what a successful contribution experience would look like as a new person transitions from &ldquo;explorer&rdquo; stage in the chart above to &ldquo;associate&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly have a perfect template for what &ldquo;clearing a path&rdquo; looks like in every case. It depends quite a bit on the nature of the contributor. But there are some common themes that I&rsquo;ve found effective:</p>

<p>First, provide good, concise documentation both on the project&rsquo;s purpose and vision and how to get started easily and keep it up to date. For projects with a front-end web component, I try to decouple the front end parts from the backend services so that people can <code>yarn install &amp;&amp; yarn start</code> <a href="/blog/2014/09/hacking-on-the-treeherder-front-end-refreshingly-easy/">their way to success</a>. Being able to <em>see</em> the project in action quickly (and not getting stuck on some mundane getting started step) is key in maintaining initial interest.</p>

<p>Second, provide a set of good starter issues (sometimes called &ldquo;good first bugs&rdquo;) for people to work on. Generally these would be non-critical-path type issues that have straightforward instructions to resolve and fix. Again, the idea here is to give people a sense of quick progress and resolution, a &ldquo;yes I can actually do this&rdquo; sort of feeling. But be careful not to let a contributor get stuck here! These bugs take a disproportionate amount of effort to file and mentor compared to their actual value &mdash; the key is to progress the contributor to the next level once it&rsquo;s clear they can handle the basics involved in solving such an issue (checking out the source code, applying a fix, submitting a patch, etc). Otherwise you&rsquo;re going to feel frustrated and wonder why you&rsquo;re on an endless treadmill of writing up trivial bugs.</p>

<p>Third, once a contributor has established themselves by fixing a few of these simple issues, I try to get to know them a little better. Send them an email, learn where they&rsquo;re from, invite them to chat on the project channel if they can. At the same time, this is an opportunity to craft a somewhat larger piece of work (a sort of mini-project) that they can do, tailored to the interests. For example, a new contributor on the Mission Control has recently been working on adding <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> tests to the project &mdash; I provided some basic guidance of things to look at, but did not dictate exactly <em>how</em> to perform the task. They figured that out for themselves.</p>

<p>As time goes by, you just continue this process. Depending on the contributor, they may start coming up with their own ideas for how a project might be improved or they might still want to follow your lead (or that of the team), but at the least I generally see an improvement in their self-directedness and confidence after a period of sustained contribution. In either case, the key to success remains the same: sustained and positive communication and sharing of goals and aspirations, making sure that both parties are getting something positive out of the experience. Where possible, I try to include contributors in team meetings. Where there&rsquo;s an especially close working relationship (e.g. <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/">Google Summer of Code</a>). I try to set up a weekly one on one. Regardless, I make reviewing code, answering questions, and providing suggestions on how to move forward a top priority (i.e. not something I&rsquo;ll leave for a few days). It&rsquo;s the least I can do if someone is willing to take time out to contribute to my project.</p>

<p>If this seems similar to the best practices for how members of a team should onboard each other and work together, that&rsquo;s not really a coincidence. Obviously the relationship is a little different because we&rsquo;re not operating with a formal managerial structure and usually the work is unpaid: I try to bear that mind and make double sure that contributors are really getting some useful skills and habits that they can take with them to future jobs and other opportunities, while also emphasizing that their code contributions are their own, not Mozilla&rsquo;s. So far it seems to have worked out pretty well for all concerned (me, Mozilla, and the contributors).</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2018/06/mission-control-1-0/">Mission Control 1.0</a></h2>
    <p class="index-date">Jun 5th, 2018</p>

<p>Just a quick announcement that the first &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo; version of Mission Control just went live yesterday, at this easy-to-remember URL:</p>

<p><a href="https://missioncontrol.telemetry.mozilla.org">https://missioncontrol.telemetry.mozilla.org</a></p>

<p>For those not yet familiar with the project, Mission Control aims to track release stability and quality across Firefox releases. It is similar in spirit to arewestableyet and other crash dashboards, with the following new and exciting properties:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Uses the full set of crash counts gathered via telemetry, rather than the arbitrary  sample that users decide to submit to crash-stats</li>
 <li>Results are available within minutes of ingestion by telemetry (although be warned  <a href="/blog/2017/10/better-or-worse-by-what-measure/">initial results for a release always look bad</a>)</li>
 <li>The denominator in our crash rate is usage hours, rather than the probably-incorrect  calculation of active-daily-installs used by  <a href="https://arewestableyet.com">arewestableyet</a> (not a knock on the people who  wrote that tool, there was nothing better available at the time)</li>
 <li>We have a detailed breakdown of the results by platform (rather than letting Windows  results dominate the overall rates due to its high volume of usage)</li></ul>

<p>In general, my hope is that this tool will provide a more scientific and accurate idea of release stability and quality over time. There&rsquo;s lots more to do, but I think this is a promising start. Much gratitude to <a href="https://home.kairo.at/blog/2014-04/how_effective_is_the_stability_program">kairo</a>, calixte, <a href="https://chuttenblog.wordpress.com/">chutten</a> and others who helped build my understanding of this area.</p>

<p>The dashboard itself an easier thing to show than talk about, so I recorded a quick demonstration of some of the dashboard&rsquo;s capabilities and published it on air mozilla:</p>

<p>Just wanted to give a quick update on some things that have been happening with the <a href="https://www.metricsgraphics.org">metrics graphics</a> since I stepped up to help with maintainership a few months ago:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/hamilton">Hamilton</a>&rsquo;s back as co-maintainer! This has been especially helpful  as he understands much of the historical context of metricsgraphics better than I do.</li>
 <li>We&rsquo;ve merged in a large number of small fixes and improvements into the codebase,  thanks to myself and a number of other contributors. Special shout-out to Thomas  Champagne, who has contributed a <a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/commits?author=thomaschampagne">large number of nifty new features</a>.</li>
 <li>We moved the project from Mozilla to its <a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/">own organization</a> on  github. This feels like a much better way forward for a project which is supposed to be useful  far outside the bounds of Mozilla, and hopeful makes contributors feel more like the first-class  citizens of the project that they actually are.</li>
 <li>We have a GSOC intern! As part of the Mozilla GSOC, Yunhao Zheng is going to be working on  adding rich brushing/zooming support to Metrics Graphics, which should be quite useful for  visualizing complex data in projects like <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KIOJtemqlCBktDdfdjDuS4XhICeaKO3QhNRwbnnf-g/">Project outline</a>, <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5422620527296512">Yunhao&rsquo;s proposal</a>)</li></ul>

<p>Yep, still working on this project. We&rsquo;ve shifted gears somewhat from trying to identify problems in a time series of error aggregates to tracking somewhat longer term trends release over release, to fill the needs of the release management team at Mozilla. It&rsquo;s been a good change, I think. A bit of a tighter focus.</p>

<p>The main motivator for this work is that the ADI (active daily install) numbers that crash stats used to provide as input to a similar service, <a href="https://arewestableyet.com">AreWeStableYet</a> (link requires Mozilla credentials), are going away and we need some kind of replacement. I&rsquo;ve been learning about this older system worked (this <a href="https://home.kairo.at/blog/2014-04/how_effective_is_the_stability_program">blog post</a> from KaiRo was helpful) and trying to develop a replacement which reproduces some of its useful characteristics while also taking advantage of some of the new features that are provided by the <a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/streaming/error_aggregates/reference.html">error_aggregates</a> dataset and the mission control user interface.</p>

<p>Some preliminary screenshots of what I&rsquo;ve been able to come up with:</p>

<center><img style="width:400px" srcset="/files/2018/04/missioncontrol-main-view.png 2x" /> <img style="width:400px" srcset="/files/2018/04/missioncontrol-windows-release.png 2x" /></center>

<p>One of the key things to keep in mind with this dashboard is that by default it shows an <em>adjusted</em> set of rates (defined as total number of events divided by total usage khours), which means we compare the latest release to the previous one within the same time interval.</p>

<p>So if, say, the latest release is &ldquo;59&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s been out for two weeks, we will compare it against the previous release (&ldquo;58&rdquo;) in its first two weeks. As I&rsquo;ve said here before, things are <a href="/blog/2017/10/better-or-worse-by-what-measure">always crashier when they first go out</a>, and comparing a new release to one that has been out in the field for some time is not a fair comparison at all.</p>

<p>This adjusted view of things is still not apples-to-apples: the causality of crashes and errors is so complex that there will always be differences between releases which are beyond our control or even understanding. Many crash reports, for example, have nothing to do with our product but with third party software and web sites beyond our control. That said, I feel like this adjusted rate is still good enough to tell us (broadly speaking) (1) whether our latest release / beta / nightly is ok (i.e. there is no major showstopper issue) and (2) whether our overall error rate is going up or down over several versions (if there is a continual increase in our crash rate, it might point to a problem in our release/qa process).</p>

<p>Interestingly, the first things that we&rsquo;ve found with this system are not real problems with the product but data collection issues:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447161">we don&rsquo;t seem to be collecting counts of gmplugin crashes on Windows anymore via telemetry</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1413172#c8">the number of content_shutdown_crashes is greater than the number of content_crashes, even though the former is a superset of the latter</a></li></ul>

<p>Data issues aside, the indications are that there&rsquo;s been a steady increase in the quality of Firefox over the last few releases based on the main user facing error metric we&rsquo;ve cared about in the past (main crashes), so that&rsquo;s good. :)</p>

<p>If you want to play with the system yourself, the <a href="https://data-missioncontrol.dev.mozaws.net/">development instance</a> is still up. We will probably look at making this thing &ldquo;official&rdquo; next quarter.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2018/02/derived-versus-direct/">Derived versus direct</a></h2>

    <p><span class="tags"><a href="/tags/Mozilla.html">Mozilla</a>  <a href="/tags/Data-Visualization.html">Data Visualization</a>  <a href="/tags/Mission-Control.html">Mission Control</a></span></p>
  </header>

<p>To attempt to make complex phenomena more understandable, we often use derived measures when representing Telemetry data at Mozilla. For error rates for example, we often measure things in terms of &ldquo;X per khours of use&rdquo; (where X might be &ldquo;main crashes&rdquo;, &ldquo;appearance of the slow script dialogue&rdquo;). I.e. instead of showing a raw <em>count</em> of errors we show a rate. Normally this is a good thing: it allows the user to easily compare two things which might have different raw numbers for whatever reason but where you&rsquo;d normally expect the ratio to be similar. For example, we see that although the <em>uptake</em> of the newly-released Firefox 58.0.2 is a bit slower than 58.0.1, the overall crash rate (as sampled every 5 minutes) is more or less the same after about a day has rolled around:</p>

<p><img srcset="/files/2018/02/main_crashes_normalized.png" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, looking at raw counts doesn&rsquo;t really give you much of a hint on how to interpret the results. Depending on the scale of the graph, the actual rates could actually resolve to being vastly different:</p>

<p><img srcset="/files/2018/02/main_crashes_raw.png" /></p>

<p>Ok, so this simple tool (using a ratio) is useful. Yay! Unfortunately, there is one case where using this technique can lead to a very deceptive visualization: when the number of samples is really small, a few outliers can give a really false impression of what&rsquo;s really happening. Take this graph of what the crash rate looked like <em>just after</em> Firefox 58.0 was released:</p>

<p><img srcset="/files/2018/02/relative_small_crash_counts.png" /></p>

<p>10 to 100 errors per 1000 hours, say it isn&rsquo;t so? But wait, how many errors do we have absolutely? Hovering over a representative point in the graph with the normalization (use of a ratio) turned off:</p>

<p><img srcset="/files/2018/02/absolute_small_crash_counts.png" /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re really only talking about something between 1 to 40 crashes events over a relatively small number of usage hours. This is clearly so little data that we can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t) draw any kind of conclusion whatsoever.</p>

<p>Ok, so that&rsquo;s just science 101: don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions based on small, vastly unrepresentative samples. Unfortunately due to human psychology people tend to assume that charts like this are authoritative and represent something real, absent an explanation otherwise &mdash; and the use of a ratio obscured the one fact (extreme lack of data) that would have given the user a hint on how to correctly interpret the results. Something to keep in mind as we build our tools.</p>
