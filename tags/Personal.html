<p>Been struggling with depression over the past couple of weeks. Some of this is seasonal (with the shortening of the days), though I wouldn&rsquo;t say it <em>always</em> happens. Last year at this time I recall feeling the <em>opposite</em> of depressed: that probably had to do with the fact that I knew I was leaving my previous job at Mozilla and wanted to get as much done as possible. Sometimes a highly motivating life situation can keep it in abeyance. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s here now, again, and demands to be dealt with.</p>

<p>What does depression even mean? It&rsquo;s a bit of a hard thing to pin down, exactly. But from the perspective of looking after my own well being, I don&rsquo;t think I really need a definition. What matters are the symptoms, which I&rsquo;d roughly express as:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Knowing what I <em>should</em> be doing but not able to do it</li>
 <li>An increase in time spent scanning social media, news sites</li>
 <li>Feelings of low self worth</li>
 <li>Feelings that nothing really matters</li>
 <li>Lack of creativity, improvisation</li>
 <li>An increase in self-referential thinking (this post would be an example of that)</li></ul>

<p>A few things I tend to try to diminish its effects:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Go outside, expose myself to sunlight. Explore nature.</li>
 <li>Exercise</li>
 <li>Meditate</li>
 <li>Eat less carbohydrates, more vegetables and protein</li>
 <li>Talk to friends</li>
 <li>Do nice things for other people</li></ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like doing these things but I try with all my might, against all my will, to do them anyway. Any individual action might not do much: but the cumulative effect of doing <em>all</em> of the above seems to have an impact &mdash; or at least that&rsquo;s what I tell myself.</p>

<p>And yet despite my best efforts, it&rsquo;s not always enough. I do all of the things in the second list, and yet still find myself suffering in all the ways described by the first. What do I do then?</p>

<p>I try to understand that there really isn&rsquo;t an escape from unpleasant feeling, and that it&rsquo;s just part of life: glorious and beautiful in its complexity. I try to be <em>curious</em> about what&rsquo;s going on, even if I think it&rsquo;s all happened before. If that&rsquo;s not possible, I at least try to be present with it. That&rsquo;s all I can do.</p>
