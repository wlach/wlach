  </header>

<p>Just wanted to talk about some recent performance improvements we&rsquo;ve made recently to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Treeherder">Treeherder</a>:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1311511">Bug 1311511</a>: Changed the repository endpoint so we don&rsquo;t do 40 redundant database  queries (this was generally innocuous, but could delay loading by  400ms if the database was under heavy load).</li>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310016">Bug 1310016</a>: Persisted database connections across requests (this  can save ~40&ndash;50ms per request, of which there can be 5&ndash;10  when loading a Treeherder page).</li>
 <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308782">Bug 1308782</a>: <em>Don&rsquo;t</em> download job type and group information  from the server to get a &ldquo;sorting order&rdquo; for the job lists. This was  never necessary, but it&rsquo;s gotten exponentially more painful as  people have added job types to Treeherder (job type information is  now around a megabyte of JSON these days). This saves 5&ndash;10 seconds on a  typical page load.</li></ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to come, but with these changes Treeherder should be faster for everyone to load. It should be particularly noticeable on try pushes, where the last item was by far the largest bottleneck. Here&rsquo;s a youtube video of the changes:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNJGoZhA4Vs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>The original is on the left. The newer, faster Treeherder is on the right. Pay particular attention to how much faster the job information populates.</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Optimization can be helpful, but it&rsquo;s better if you can avoid doing the work altogether.</p>

<p>For every commit to Firefox, we run a battery of builds and automated tests on the resulting source tree to make sure that the result still works and meets our correctness and performance quality criteria. This is expensive: every new push to our repository implies hundreds of hours of machine time. However, automated quality control is essential to ensure that the product that we&rsquo;re shipping to users is something that we can be proud of.</p>

<p>But what about evaluating the quality of the product which does the building and testing? Who does that? And by what criteria would we say that our automation system is good or bad? Up to now, our procedures for this have been rather embarassingly adhoc. With some exceptions (such as <a href="https://brasstacks.mozilla.com/orangefactor/">OrangeFactor</a>), our QA process amounts to motivated engineers doing a one-off analysis of a particular piece of the system, filing a few bugs, then forgetting about it. Occasionally someone will propose turning build and test automation for a specific platform on or off in mozilla.dev.planning.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to suggest that the time has come to take a more systemic approach to this class of problem. We spend a lot of money on people and machines to maintain this infrastructure, and I think we need a more disciplined approach to make sure that we are getting good value for that investment.</p>

<p>As a starting point, I feel like we need to pay closer attention to the following characteristics of our automation:</p>

<ul>
 <li>End-to-end times from push submission to full completion of all  build and test jobs: if this gets too long, it makes the lives  of all sorts of people painful &mdash; tree closures become longer when  they happen (because it takes longer to either notice bustage or  find out that it&rsquo;s fixed), developers have to wait longer for  try pushes (making them more likely to just push directly to an  integration branch, causing the former problem&hellip;)</li>
 <li>Number of machine hours consumed by the different types of test  jobs: our resources are large (relatively speaking), but not  unlimited. We need proper accounting of where we&rsquo;re spending money  and time. In some cases, resources used to perform a task that  we don&rsquo;t care that much about could be redeployed towards an  underresourced task that we do care about. A good example of this  was linux32 talos (performance tests) last year: when the question  was raised of why we were doing performance testing on this specific  platform (in addition to Linux64), no one could come up with a great  justification. So we turned the tests off and reconfigured the machines  to do Windows performance tests (where we were suffering from a severe  lack of capacity).</li></ul>

<p>Over the past week, I&rsquo;ve been prototyping a project I&rsquo;ve been calling &ldquo;Infraherder&rdquo; which uses the data inside <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org">Treeherder</a>&rsquo;s job database to try to answer these questions (and maybe some others that I haven&rsquo;t thought of yet). You can see a hacky version of it on <a href="http://wlach.github.io/treeherder/ui/infra.html#/last-finished">my github fork</a>.</p>

<p>Why implement this in Treeherder you might ask? Two reasons. First, Treeherder already stores the job data in a historical archive that&rsquo;s easy to query (using SQL). Using this directly makes sense over creating a new data store. Second, Treeherder provides a useful set of front-end components with which to build a UI with which to visualize this information. I actually did my initial prototyping inside an ipython notebook, but it quickly became obvious that for my results to be useful to others at Mozilla we needed some kind of real dashboard that people could dig into.</p>

<p>On the Treeherder team at Mozilla, we&rsquo;ve found the <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> software to be invaluable for diagnosing and fixing quality and performance problems for Treeherder itself, so I took some inspiration from it (unfortunately the problem space of our automation is not quite the same as that of a web application, so we can&rsquo;t just use New Relic directly).</p>

<p>There are currently two views in the prototype, a &ldquo;last finished&rdquo; view and a &ldquo;total&rdquo; view. I&rsquo;ll describe each of them in turn.</p>

<h3 id="last-finished">Last finished</h3>

<p>This view shows the counts of which scheduled automation jobs were the &ldquo;last&rdquo; to finish. The hypothesis is that jobs that are frequently last indicate blockers to developer productivity, as they are the &ldquo;long pole&rdquo; in being able to determine if a push is good or bad.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-last-finished.png" width="500px" /></p>

<p>Right away from this view, you can see the mochitest devtools 9 test is often the last to finish on try, with Windows 7 mochitest debug a close second. Assuming that the reasons for this are not resource starvation (they don&rsquo;t appear to be), we could probably get results into the hands of developers and sheriffs faster if we split these jobs into two seperate ones. I filed bugs <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294489">1294489</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294706">1294706</a> to address these issues.</p>

<h3 id="total-time">Total Time</h3>

<p>This view just shows which jobs are taking up the most machine hours.</p>

<p><img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-total.png" width="500px" /></p>

<p>Probably unsurprisingly, it seems like it&rsquo;s Android test jobs that are taking up most of the time here: these tests are running on multiple layers of emulation (AWS instances to emulate Linux hardware, then the already slow QEMU-based Android simulator) so are not expected to have fast runtime. I wonder if it might not be worth considering running these tests on faster instances and/or bare metal machines.</p>

<p>Linux32 debug tests seem to be another large consumer of resources. Market conditions make turning these tests off altogether a non-starter (see bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255890">1255890</a>), but how much value do we really derive from running the debug version of linux32 through automation (given that we&rsquo;re already doing the same for 64-bit Linux)?</p>

<h3 id="request-for-comments">Request for comments</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SrlJQQ3qWuM0tvruG6Lr59t3hJ4XRUoMIrIRQYvwu9A/edit?usp=sharing">an RFC</a> for this project on Google Docs, as a sort of test case for a new process we&rsquo;re thinking of using in Engineering Productivity for these sorts of projects. If you have any questions or comments, I&rsquo;d love to hear them! My perspective on this vast problem space is limited, so I&rsquo;m sure there are things that I&rsquo;m missing.</p>

  </header>

<p>Following on the footsteps of Mike Ling&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2015/09/perfherder-summer-of-contribution-thoughts/">amazing work</a> on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ngineeringProductivity‎/Projects/Perfherder">Perfherder</a> in 2015 (he&rsquo;s gone on to do a GSOC project), I got two amazing contributors to continue working on the project for a few weeks this summer as part of our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution">quarter of contribution</a> program: Shruti Jasoria and Roy Chiang.</p>

<p>Shruti started by adding a feature to the treeherder/perfherder backend (ability to enable or disable a new performance framework on a tentative basis), then went on to make all sorts of improvements to the Treeherder / Perfherder frontend, fixing bugs in the performance sheriffing frontend, updating code to use more modern standards (including a gigantic patch to enable a bunch of eslint rules and fix the corresponding problems).</p>

<p>Roy worked all over the codebase, starting with some simple frontend fixes to Treeherder, moving on to fix a large number of nits in Perfherder&rsquo;s alerts view. My personal favorite is the fact that we now paginate the list of alerts inside this view, which makes navigation waaaaay back into history possible:</p>

<p><a href="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png"><img src="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png" alt="alert pagination" width="300px" /></a></p>

<p>You can see a summary of their work at these links:</p>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/commits/master?author=crosscent">Roy Chiang</a></li></ul>

<p>Thank you Shruti and Roy! You&rsquo;ve helped to make sure Firefox (and Servo!) performance remains top-notch.</p>

<p>Just wanted to announce that, once again, my team (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity">Mozilla Engineering Productivity</a>) is just about to start running another <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution">quarter of contribution</a> &mdash; a great opportunity for newer community members to dive deep on some of the projects we&rsquo;re working on, brush up on their programming and problem solving skills, and work with experienced mentors. You can find more information on this program <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Summer_2016">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found this program to be a really great experience on both sides &mdash; it&rsquo;s an opportunity for contributors to really go beyond the &ldquo;good first bug&rdquo; style of patches to having a really substantial impact on some of the projects that we&rsquo;re working on while gaining lots of software development skills that are useful in the real world.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;m going to be mentoring one or two people on the Perfherder project, a tool we use to measure and sheriff Firefox performance. If you&rsquo;re inclined to work on some really interesting data analysis and user interface problems in Python and JavaScript, please have a look at the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Perfherder">project page</a> and get in touch. :)</p>

    <p class='index-date'><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time" aria-hidden="true"></span> Mar 30th, 2016</p>
  </header>

<p>Historically at Mozilla, we&rsquo;ve had a bunch of different systems running to benchmark Firefox&rsquo;s performance. The two most broadly-scoped are <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos">Talos</a> (which runs as part of our build process, and emphasizes common real-world use cases, like page loading) and <a href="https://arewefastyet.com/">Are We Fast Yet</a> (which runs seperately, and emphasizes JavaScript performance and benchmarks).</p>

<p>As many of you know, most of my focus over the last year-and-a-bit has been developing a system called Perfherder, which aims to make monitoring and acting on performance data easier. A great introduction to Perfherder is my <a href="/blog/2016/03/platform-engineering-project-of-the-month-perfherder/">project of the month post</a>.</p>

<p>The initial focus of Perfherder has been Talos, which is deeply integrated into our automation and also maintained by Engineering Productivity (my group). However, the intention was always to allow anyone in the Mozilla community to submit performance data for Firefox and sheriff it, much like Treeherder has supported the submission of test result data from third parties (e.g. autophone, Firefox UI tests). There are more commonalities than differences in how we do performance sheriffing with Are We Fast Yet (which currently has its own web interface) and Perfherder, so it made sense to see if we could pool resources.</p>

<p>So, over the last couple of months, <a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/">Joel Maher</a> and I have been in discussions with Hannes Verschore, current maintainer of Are We Fast Yet (AWFY) to see what could be done. It looks like it is possible for Perfherder to provide most of what AWFY needs, though there are a few exceptions. I thought for the benefit of others, it might be useful to outline what&rsquo;s done, what&rsquo;s coming next, and what might not be implemented (at least not any time soon).</p>

<h3 id="whats-done">What&rsquo;s done</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Get AWFY submitting data to Perfherder and allow it to be sheriffed  seperately from Talos. This is working on treeherder stage, and you  can already examine the <a href="https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html#/alerts?status=0&amp;framework=5">alert data</a>.</li></ul>

<h3 id="whats-in-progress-or-in-the-near-term-pipeline">What&rsquo;s in progress (or in the near-term pipeline)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Allow custom alerting behaviour (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1254595">bug 1254595</a>). For example, we want  to alert on subtests for AWFY while still summarizing the results.  This is something we don&rsquo;t currently support.</li>
 <li>Allow creating an alert manually (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260791">bug 1260791</a>). Sadly, our regression detection  algorithm is not perfect. AWFY already supports this, we should too. This is something we also want for Talos.</li>
 <li>Make regression-filing templates non-talos-specific (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260805">bug 1260805</a>). Currently we have a convenience template for filing bugs for performance  regressions, but this is currently specific to various things about Talos (job running instructions, links to documentation, etc.). We should  make it configurable so other projects like AWFY can take advantage of this functionality.</li></ul>

<h3 id="under-consideration">Under consideration</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Some kind of support for bisecting a push to figure out which patch  caused a regression. AWFY currently supports this, but it&rsquo;s a fairly  difficult thing to add to Perfherder (much of which is built upon  Treeherder&rsquo;s per-push result model). Maybe this is something we should  do, but it would be a significant amount of effort.</li>
 <li>Proprietary benchmarks: AWFY runs one benchmark the results for  which we can&rsquo;t make public. Adding &ldquo;private&rdquo; jobs or results to  Treeherder is likely a big can of worms, but it might be something  we want to do eventually.</li></ul>

<h3 id="probably-wont-fix">Probably won&rsquo;t fix</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Supporting comparative measurements between Firefox and other  browsers. This is an important task, but doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the  model of Perfherder, which is intimately tied to the revision data  associated with Firefox. To do this would require detailed tracking  of Chrome on the same basis, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really a place  where we want to go. We should definitely monitor for general  trends, but I think that is best done with a seperate system.</li></ul>

<p><em>[ originally posted on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/itdfru6csSk/vfVP_WDXBgAJ">mozilla.dev.platform</a> ]</em></p>

<p>Hello from Platform Engineering Operations! Once a month we highlight one of our projects to help the Mozilla community discover a useful tool or an interesting contribution opportunity.</p>

<p>This month’s project is Perfherder!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-perfherder">What is Perfherder?</h3>

<p>Perfherder is a generic system for visualizing and analyzing performance data produced by the many automated tests we run here at Mozilla (such as Talos, &ldquo;Are we fast yet?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are we slim yet?&rdquo;). The chief goal of the project is to make sure that performance of Firefox gets better, not worse over time. It does this by:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Tracking the performance generated by our automated tests, allowing  them to be visualized on a graph.</li>
 <li>Providing a sheriffing dashboard which allows for incoming  alerts of performance regressions to be annotated and triaged - bugs  can be filed based on a template and their resolution status can be  tracked.</li></ul>

<p>In addition to its own user interface, Perfherder also provides an API on the backend that other people can use to build custom performance visualizations and dashboards. For example, the metrics group has been working on a set of release quality indices for performance based on Perfherder data:</p>

<p><a href="https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/">https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/</a></p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>Perfherder is part of Treeherder, building on that project&rsquo;s existing support for tracking revision and test job information. Like the rest of Treeherder, Perfherder&rsquo;s backend is written in Python, using the Django web framework. The user interface is written as an AngularJS application.</p>

<h3 id="learning-more">Learning more</h3>

<p>For more information on Perfherder than you ever wanted to know, please see the wiki page:</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder">https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder</a></p>

<h3 id="can-i-contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>

<p>Yes! We have had some fantastic contributions from the community to Perfherder, and are always looking for more. This is a great way to help developers make Firefox faster (or use less memory). The core of Perfherder is relatively small, so this is a great chance to learn either Django or Angular if you have a small amount of Python and/or JavaScript experience.</p>

<p>We have set aside a set of bugs that are suitable for getting started here:</p>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;resolution=---&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;resolution=---&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small thing, but I submitted a patch to <a href="http://trychooser.pub.build.mozilla.org/">trychooser</a> last week which adds a tooltip indicating the actual Talos tests that are run as part of the various jobs that you can schedule as part of a try push. It&rsquo;s in production as of now:</p>

<video src="/files/2016/02/talos-trychooser.webm" controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay"></video>

<p>Previously, the only way to do this was to dig into the actual buildbot code, which was more than a little annoying.</p>

<p>If you think your patch might have a good chance of regressing performance, please do run the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests">Talos tests</a> before you check in. It&rsquo;s much less work for all of us when these things are caught before integration and back outs are no fun for anyone. We really need better documentation for this stuff, but meanwhile if you need help with this, please ask in the #perf channel on irc.mozilla.org</p>

<p>I was saddened to find out last week that the person who introduced me to Zen practice three years ago, Albert Low, has passed away. Albert was the teacher of the <a href="http://www.zenmontreal.ca/">Montreal Zen Center</a>, which I was a member of for a brief period (6 months) in 2014 before I moved to Toronto and started practicing at <a href="http://torontozen.org/">the center</a> here.</p>

<p>Albert&rsquo;s instruction was the gateway to a practice that has had a profound impact on my life. More than anything, he helped me understand Zen as something that one could incorporate directly into daily life. I will remain forever grateful.</p>

<p>As my blog goes to github pages, so do my other side projects. I just moved nixi, my bikestation finder project, to github pages. Its new location:</p>

<p><a href="http://wlach.github.io/nixi">http://wlach.github.io/nixi</a></p>

<p>I opted not to move over the domain: it would have cost extra money, time and hassle and I couldn&rsquo;t justify it for the very, very small number of people that still use this site (yes, there are a few, including myself!). For now, nixi.ca will redirect to the github pages site until I decommision my linode server, probably at the end of January (end of Feburary at the latest).</p>

<p>This transition brings some other changes with it:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Now using the <a href="https://citybik.es">citybik.es</a> API directly,  instead of proxing through an intermediary server. This was necessitated  by the switch to github pages, but I suspect this will be more reliable  than what we were doing before. Thanks citybik.es!</li>
 <li>Removed all analytics and facebook integration. As with the domain, it didn&rsquo;t  seem worth bringing over. Also, it&rsquo;s nice to give people at least marginally  more privacy than they had before where possible.</li></ul>

<p>I still think nixi is worlds more usable than most bikesharing maps, even if it&rsquo;s not an actively maintained project of mine any more. Here&rsquo;s hoping it lasts many more years in its new incarnation.</p>

<p>After thinking about doing it for longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit, I finally bit the bullet and decided to migrate away from WordPress, towards a markdown-based blog generator (<a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog">Frog</a> in this case). All the content from the old blog is coming with me (thanks mostly to WordPress&rsquo;s jekyll exporter plugin).</p>

<p>While WordPress is a pretty impressive piece of software, it isn&rsquo;t the ideal platform for the sorts of things I want to express. It&rsquo;s a reasonable tool for publishing straight longform essays, but my more interesting posts tend to also include images, code and examples, and sometimes <a href="/blog/2014/03/it-8217-s-all-about-the-entropy/">even math</a>. Making those look reasonable involved a bunch of manual effort and the end result wasn&rsquo;t particularly great. I was particularly disappointed in its (lack of) support for inline code snippits.</p>

<p>Perhaps this set of problems is resolvable by installing the right set of plugins. Perhaps. But therein lies my second problem with WordPress: it&rsquo;s big, complex piece of software written in PHP, and I&rsquo;m frankly tired of figuring out how to (barely) make it do the things I need it to do, while half-worrying that the new fancy WPAwesome plugin I&rsquo;m installing is malware.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve grown older, I&rsquo;m increasingly realizing the limits to what I have the time (and energy) to accomplish. While &ldquo;Making WordPress do the things I want&rdquo; is something I <em>could</em> continue working on, it would come at the expense of other things that I find more rewarding, whether that be meditating, <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">brushing up on deep learning</a>, or even just writing more stuff here. I don&rsquo;t expect this new blog to be maintenance free, but it should be an order of magnitude simpler using Frog, which is narrowly focused on my rather technical use case and specifically has great support for inline code, images, and math.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, I&rsquo;m completely tired of maintaining the Linux server that my blog ran on. Registering domains and setting up my own HTTP server seemed like an interesting diversion in 2009, when cheap Linux VPSes were first starting to appear on the market. These days&hellip; well, not so much. It&rsquo;s a minor, though not completely trivial, expense ($10 USD/mo.) but more importantly it&rsquo;s a sink of my time to install security patches, make sure things are to up to date, etc. It feels like I&rsquo;m solving the same (boring) set of problems over and over, with no real payoff. Time to move on.</p>

<p>Thus, this blog (along with my other hosted projects, like <a href="http://nixi.ca">NIXI</a> and <a href="meditation.wrla.ch">meditation</a>) will be moving to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. Initially I had the worry that this move would mean that I wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;in control of my own destiny&rdquo;, but on reflection I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. The fact that my blog is basically a giant git repository should make switching hosting providers quite easy if Github becomes unsatisfactory for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Indeed, even the custom domain (wrla.ch) seems unnecessary at this point. Although github pages does support them, I&rsquo;m just not seeing the value in keeping it around. What purpose does it <em>really</em> serve? All a custom personal domain really says to me is that the person had the time/money to register it. Is that something that someone in my position really needs to communicate? And if I don&rsquo;t need it, why continue with the unnecessary expense and hassle?</p>

<p>Perhaps the only legitimate reason to keep the domain would be continuity for readers (i.e. there&rsquo;s a link or two in their browser history), but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a big deal in my case. Yes, people might occasionally be thrown off and have to use Yahoo/Google to re-find something&hellip; but for the type of content I host, I don&rsquo;t think that will take too much collective time. In the grand stream of things, I&rsquo;m pretty small potatoes. Most of my traffic just comes through planet.mozilla.org, and that&rsquo;s easy to redirect automatically.</p>

<p>So though I&rsquo;ll be keeping around wrla.ch for a little bit to give people time to migrate their links (it doesn&rsquo;t expire until the end of February 2016), it will also be going away. Please redirect your feed readers to <a href="https://wlach.github.io">wlach.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>Now, onto more interesting things!</p>
