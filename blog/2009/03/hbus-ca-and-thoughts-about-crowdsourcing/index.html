<p>So I opened up my baby, <a href="http://hbus.ca" title="hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a>, to the public last week (though traffic only really started to pick up yesterday, after a <a href="http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/201622">positive article</a> in the daily news). This site, a trip planner for the Halifax Regional Municipality, was the cumulation of about 6 months of part time work on my part, between contracts for my awesome company, <a href="http://navarra.ca">Navarra</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m debating on whether or not to start a seperate blog for hbus. At the moment I&rsquo;m leaning towards no: my thinking is that most people don&rsquo;t care about the inner workings of a site like hbus. They just want to figure out how to get from point A to B. Those who do care can read the rest of what I (and my part time co-conspirator, <a href="http://cpirate.livejournal.com">Peter McCurdy</a>) have to say.</p>

<p>The most glaring limitation in hbus right now is that its route coverage is woefully limited. Trips on the main Halifax peninsula are generally planned pretty effectively. If you&rsquo;re travelling to a suburban area like Bayer&rsquo;s Lake or Burnside, not so much (unless you&rsquo;re lucky enough to be starting/ending near a bus timepoint). What is to be done?</p>

<p>A frequent suggestion I get from more technically minded folks is that I should &ldquo;crowd source&rdquo; the missing information. This basically implies creating a wikipedia-like architecture such that people could contribute their favourite stops, routes, etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tempting idea. Such sites as <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> show that this approach can be very effective for gathering large amount of geographical data. I&rsquo;m frankly not convinced it&rsquo;s the right approach here though. The fact is that <a href="http://halifax.ca/metrotransit">Metro Transit</a> MUST have a complete set of stops, route schedules, and route plans internally. There&rsquo;s no way they could plan their operations halfway effectively otherwise. Why should I burden the public with the task of recreating something which has already been done?</p>

<p>I may be crazy, but I think the best avenue for the moment is to try to convince Metro Transit that it would be worthwhile to make this information public. I paid for the generation of the information with my tax dollars, why shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to make use of it? The preferred format for this information is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/">Google Transit Data Feed</a>, but I could make use of information in just about any representation (Arc GIS, etc.). Just give me what you have, and I&rsquo;ll take of the rest. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds">Over 20</a> of the most successful transit agencies in North America (many of them much bigger than Metro Transit) have opened up their information to the public, with only positive results.</p>

<p>The most obvious use of this information is a trip planner and, yes, I know every agency and their dog has (or will have) one of these. But maybe someone has a cool idea on how to make a trip planner easier to use (compare <a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a> with <a href="www.stm.info/azimuts/index.htm">Tous Azimuts</a>). Or what about <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/transit-map.php">transit maps</a> that help people figure out where to live? Or iPhone and Blackberry applications? Or cool <a href="http://myttc.ca/screensaver">screensavers</a>? Or or or. The possibilities are truly endless once the data is out there. Come on Metro Transit, you have nothing to lose and the eternal love of your ridership to gain.</p>
