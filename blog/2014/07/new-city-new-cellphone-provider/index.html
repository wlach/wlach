<p>Rogers, my previous cell phone provider, is ridiculous.</p>

<p>So for those of you who don&#8217;t know, I just moved from Montreal to Toronto. There are very few people who call me these days, but some still do and keeping my old Montreal number subjects me to a bunch of long distance fees I didn&#8217;t want to pay every time someone dials my number while I&#8217;m here.</p>

<p>I really didn&#8217;t want to go to the trouble of changing my cellphone company, so was ready to just switch my number and keep my $60/mo. plan with Rogers. I knew it was kind of expensive, but they haven&#8217;t given me much trouble and I do put a premium on my time not being occupied with changing service providers. I also figured I had bigger fish to fry in terms of finding budgetary savings.</p>

<p>But no, apparently the &#8220;market&#8221; in Ontario is &#8220;less competitive&#8221;, so my plan doesn&#8217;t exist here. After an hour and several levels of polite escalation (in strict violation of the &#8220;don&#8217;t waste my time&#8221; rule), the best they could give me was a $70/mo. plan (a $10 increase) with a decrease of 3gb data -&gt; 2gb. I gave them plenty of opportunities to relent, but they wouldn&#8217;t budge. They claimed there was no reasonable alternative.</p>

<p>Did some shopping around&#8211; unfortunately Wind (the best value) didn&#8217;t seem to work with my Nexus 5, so I went with Virgin Mobile who looked like the next best option. Up and running in just half an hour, and will probably be paying no more than $50 a month now.</p>

<p>So what happened to the legendary Rogers customer retention department? How do they think they can get away charging these kinds of rates?</p>
