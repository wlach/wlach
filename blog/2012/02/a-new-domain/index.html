    <h1>A new domain</h1>

<p>A few years ago, I fancied the idea of creating my own software consulting business. For some reason, I thought &#8220;Masala Labs&#8221; would be a cool and witty name for it (&#8220;masala&#8221; means spice mixture in Hindi, and who doesn&#8217;t like spicy things?), so I registered the domain along with the associated small business paperwork in Nova Scotia. I only ever had one client, and it was only a few months before I wound up joining a few of my colleagues in founding &#8220;The Navarra Group&#8221; (which is also now defunct, a story I will perhaps tell at another time), so it never got very huge.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still had my own domain, and I wanted to move my blog from livejournal, which was beginning to jump the shark. The masalalabs domain was mine, so why not use it? I created a wordpress blog, pointed my DNS registration at it, and started writing. This worked well for a while (names don&#8217;t really matter for random personal blogs), but lately I&#8217;ve been wanting to start a new project and &#8220;Masala Labs&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exactly seem like a winning banner for me to put it under.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time for a bit of a change. I just registered the swiss domain name &#8216;wrla.ch&#8217;, created a fancy new <a href="http://wrla.ch">landing page</a>, and made this blog its first &#8220;sub site&#8221;. More to come.</p>

<p>So, for all 20 of you who are subscribed to my doings, please update your links. For those of you using Google Reader / RSS, the new feed is at <a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/feed/">this URL</a>. All the old masalalabs links should at least <strong>work</strong> until the domain expires in a few years, so there&#8217;s no huge rush. Then again, you&#8217;ll probably forget if you don&#8217;t do it now (and thus be deprived of my endless ravings about checkerboarding on mobile Fennec on Android), so why wait?</p>
