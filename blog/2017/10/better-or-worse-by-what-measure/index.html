<p>Ok, after a series of posts extolling the virtues of my current project, it&rsquo;s time to take a more critical look at some of its current limitations, and what we might do about them. In my <a href="/blog/2017/10/mission-control/">introductory post</a>, I talked about how Mission Control can let us know how &ldquo;crashy&rdquo; a new release is, within a short interval of it being released. I also alluded to the fact that things appear considerably worse when something first goes out, though I didn&rsquo;t go into a lot of detail about how and why that happens.</p>

<p>It just so happens that a new point release (56.0.2) just went out, so it&rsquo;s a perfect opportunity to revisit this issue. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the graphs are saying (each of the images is also a link to the dashboard where they were generated):</p>

<p><a href="https://data-missioncontrol.dev.mozaws.net/#/release/windows/content_crashes?timeInterval=172740&amp;percentile=99&amp;normalized=1&amp;disabledVersions=&amp;versionGrouping=version&amp;startTime=1508990400"><img srcset="/files/2017/10/missioncontrol_windows_content_crashes_56.0.2.png 2x" /></a></p>

<p>ZOMG! It looks like 56.0.2 is off the charts relative to the two previous releases (56.0 and 56.0.1). Is it time to sound the alarm? Mission control abort? Well, let&rsquo;s see what happens the last time we rolled something new out, say 56.0.1:</p>

<p><a href="https://data-missioncontrol.dev.mozaws.net/#/release/windows/content_crashes?timeInterval=345540&amp;percentile=99&amp;normalized=1&amp;disabledVersions=&amp;versionGrouping=version&amp;startTime=1507435200"><img srcset="/files/2017/10/missioncontrol_windows_content_crashes_56.0.1.png 2x" /></a></p>

<p>We see the exact same pattern. Hmm. How about 56.0?</p>

<p><a href="https://data-missioncontrol.dev.mozaws.net/#/release/windows/content_crashes?timeInterval=431940&amp;percentile=99&amp;normalized=1&amp;disabledVersions=&amp;versionGrouping=version&amp;startTime=1506398400"><img srcset="/files/2017/10/missioncontrol_windows_content_crashes_56.png 2x" /></a></p>

<p>Yep, same pattern here too (actually slightly worse).</p>

<p>What could be going on? Let&rsquo;s start by reviewing what these time series graphs are based on. Each point on the graph represents the number of crashes reported by telemetry &ldquo;main&rdquo; pings corresponding to that channel/version/platform within a five minute interval, divided by the number of usage hours (how long users have had Firefox open) also reported in that interval. A main ping is submitted under <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/main-ping.html">a few circumstances</a>:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The user shuts down Firefox</li>
 <li>It’s been about 24 hours since the last time we sent a main ping.</li>
 <li>The user starts Firefox after Firefox failed to start properly</li>
 <li>The user changes something about Firefox’s environment (adds an addon, flips a user preference)</li></ul>

<p>A high crash rate either means a larger number of crashes over the same number of usage hours, or a lower number of usage hours over the same number of crashes. There are several likely explanations for why we might see this type of crashy behaviour immediately after a new release:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A Firefox update is applied after the user restarts their browser for any  reason, including their browser crash. Thus a user whose browser crashes a  lot (for any reason), is more prone to update to the latest version sooner  than a user that doesn’t crash as much.</li>
 <li>Inherently, any crash data submitted to telemetry after a new version is  released will have a low number of usage hours attached, because the  client would not have had a chance to use it much (because it&rsquo;s so new).</li></ul>

<p>Assuming that we&rsquo;re reasonably satisfied with the above explanation, there&rsquo;s a few things we could try to do to correct for this situation when implementing an &ldquo;alerting&rdquo; system for mission control (the next item on my todo list for this project):</p>

<ul>
 <li>Set &ldquo;error&rdquo; thresholds for each crash measure sufficiently high that  we don&rsquo;t consider these high initial values an error (i.e. only alert  if there is are 500 crashes per 1k hours).</li>
 <li>Only trigger an error threshold when some kind of minimum quantity of  usage hours has been observed (this has the disadvantage of potentially  obscuring a serious problem until a large percentage of the user population  is affected by it).</li>
 <li>Come up with some expected range of what we expect a value to be for  when a new version of firefox is first released and ratchet  that down as time goes on (according to some kind of model of our previous expectations).</li></ul>

<p>The initial specification for this project called for just using raw thresholds for these measures (discounting usage hours), but I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly convinced that won&rsquo;t cut it. I&rsquo;m not a quality control expert, but 500 crashes for 1k hours of use sounds completely unacceptable if we&rsquo;re measuring things at all accurately (which I believe we are given a sufficient period of time). At the same time, generating 20&ndash;30 “alerts” every time a new release went out wouldn’t particularly helpful either. Once again, we’re going to have to do this the hard way&hellip;</p>
