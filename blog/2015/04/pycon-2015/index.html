<p>So I went to PyCon 2015. While I didn&#8217;t leave quite as inspired as I did in 2014 (<a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2014/04/pycon-2014-impressions-ipython-notebook-is-the-future-more/">when I discovered iPython</a>), it was a great experience and I learned a ton. Once again, I was incredibly impressed with the organization of the conference and the diversity and quality of the speakers.</p>

<p>Since Mozilla was nice enough to sponsor my attendance, I figured I should do another round up of notable talks that I went to.</p>

<p>Technical stuff that was directly relevant to what I work on:</p>

<ul>
 <li>To ORM or not to ORM (Christine Spang): Useful talk on when using a database ORM (object relational manager) can be helpful and even faster than using a database directly. I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of misinformation and FUD on this topic, so this was refreshing to see. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sadng6tR7Q4">video</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015/christine-spang-to-orm-or-not-to-orm">slides</a></li>
 <li>Debugging hard problems (Alex Gaynor): Exactly what it says &#8212; how to figure out what&#8217;s going on when things aren&#8217;t behaving as they should. Great advice and wisdom in this one (hint: take nothing for granted, dive into the source of everything you&#8217;re using!). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij99SGGEX34">video</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/alex/techniques-for-debugging-hard-problems">slides</a></li>
 <li>Python Performance Profiling: The Guts And The Glory (Jesse Jiryu Davis): Quite an entertaining talk on how to properly profile python code. I really liked his systematic and realistic approach &#8212; which also discussed the thought process behind how to do this (hint: again it comes down to understanding what&#8217;s really going on). Unfortunately the video is truncated, but even the first few minutes are useful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJWWXYHxaM">video</a></li></ul>

<p>Non-technical stuff:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The Ethical Consequences Of Our Collective Activities (Glyph): A talk on the ethical implications of how our software is used. I feel like this is an under-discussed topic &#8212; how can we know that the results of our activity (programming) serves others and does not harm? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSbKjRRbjZs">video</a></li>
 <li>How our engineering environments are killing diversity (and how we can fix it) (Kate Heddleston): This was a great talk on how to make the environments in which we develop more welcoming to under-represented groups (women, minorities, etc.). This is something I&#8217;ve been thinking a bunch about lately, especially in the context of expanding the community of people working on our projects in Automation &#38; Tools. The talk had some particularly useful advice (to me, anyway) on giving feedback. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNke_4WOWAU">video</a> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015/kate-heddleston-how-our-engineering-environments-are-killing-diversity-and-how-we-can-fix-it">slides</a></li></ul>

<p>I probably missed out on a bunch of interesting things. If you also went to PyCon, please feel free to add links to your favorite talks in the comments!</p>
