<p>Hurrah, 2010 is upon us!</p>

<p>One new years resolution I have set for myself is to blog more about what I&#8217;m working on. I&#8217;ve learned over the last year that the audience of people who care about your projects <em>in development</em> is vanishingly small. Thus, the need for secrecy in order to make a &#8220;PR splash&#8221; is rather small&#8211; announce far and wide when you have something that <a href="http://hbus.ca">people can use</a> by all means, but don&#8217;t worry too much about talking about what you&#8217;re working on with the internets.</p>

<p>In this spirit, some projects I&#8217;m 99% certain I&#8217;ll be releasing publicly in 2010:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/wlach/neocoder">neocoder</a></strong> A lightweight geocoding library, with wrapper libraries for your language of choice. Written in C++ using <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> and boost regular expressions. Will support both <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="http://geobase.ca">GeoBase</a> GML as input. Currently in development on github, hoping to release with routez (as its geocoding component).</li>
 <li><strong>routez</strong> A generic travel planning web service, written in python using the <a href="http://django-project.org">django</a> framework and the <a href="http://github.com/wlach/libroutez">libroutez</a> libraries. This is basically the software behind <a href="http://hbus.ca">hbus.ca</a>&#8230; the goal for 2010 is to clean it up and make it generic by clearing out the Halifax-specific stuff (mostly just the geocoding and site theme stuff at this point), then release it to the public under the <a href="www.affero.org/oagpl.html">Affero GPL License</a> (was originally going to with GPL, but <a href="http://sfllaw.ca">Simon Law</a> convinced me otherwise&#8230; more on that in a future post).</li>
 <li><strong>Transit To Go</strong> A dedicated iPhone client for the routez software, developed in collaboration with <a href="http://appliedlogic.ca">Dmitri Dolguikh</a> and <a href="http://mindsea.com">Bill Wilson</a>, two talent developers from Halifax. Has some innovative (in my opinion, anyway) details on how things will be viewed. This one&#8217;s going to be proprietary, but will be affordable and awesome.</li></ul>

<p>Besides this, I have a few more irons in the fire&#8230; however, I&#8217;m hesistant to talk about them just yet. Just getting the above done in the midst of my work with <a href="http://navarra.ca">Navarra</a> (to say nothing of having a life in there somewhere) is going to be challenging.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Would be particularly interested in hearing from people working on similar projects to neocoder and routez. Despite how it may some times appear, I don&#8217;t have a NotInventedHere mentality: I&#8217;ve done as an exhaustive survey of the field as I could before deciding to work on my own projects, and what I&#8217;ve found just hasn&#8217;t been the right fit for what I&#8217;m trying to accomplish. However, the world&#8217;s gotten so damn big that I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m missing something&#8230;</p>
