&lt;p&gt;Had a good all hands with the rest of Mozilla in San Francisco (at least those able and willing to attend due to the current political situation in the U.S.). I stayed a few extra days to hang out with some of my friends who had moved to S.F. On Sunday we went to Muir Woods, where I took this picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2017/07/muirwoods-20170702.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:640px" src="/files/2017/07/muirwoods-20170702.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me at the time that I took that photo that pretty much every sensory receptor in my optic nerve was registering the signal of some kind of life. Thousands of beings (trees, clover, moss, lichens) in turn made up of trillions upon trillions of tiny beings (cells, bacteria) all conscious and interacting with each other in ways that I can barely begin to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I joined the Mozilla Data Platform team, to work on our &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry"&gt;Telemetry&lt;/a&gt; and automated data collection services. This has been an interesting transition for me, and a natural jumping off point from my work on &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt;. Now, instead of manipulating mere 10s of gigabytes worth of fairly regular data, I&amp;rsquo;m working with 100s of terrabytes of noisy data with a much larger number of dimensions. :P It&amp;rsquo;s been interesting so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I decided to work on was improving our unit testing story around a few of our primary packages for data analysis/etl: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/python_moztelemetry/"&gt;python_moztelemetry&lt;/a&gt; (a library we use for running custom spark jobs against Telemetry data) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-batch-view/"&gt;telemetry-batch-view&lt;/a&gt; (a set of scala jobs we run against the main telemetry data store to create a useful set of aggregations that are easily queried with tools like &lt;a href="https://redash.io/"&gt;redash&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these tools interact with several larger / more involved pieces than I&amp;rsquo;m used to dealing with (such as hbase and thrift). For continuous integration/automation, we already had a set of travis scripts to install and reproduce the environment needed to test these parts, but there was no straightforward way to do this locally. My third time through creating an Ubuntu virtual machine environment to reproduce this environment locally (long story), I figured it was finally time for me to investigate using something to automate that setup procedure and make it easier for new developers to get into these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it much before, but &lt;a href="https://docker.com"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; seemed like a fairly obvious choice. Small, simple, and Linuxy? Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how things turned out, but there were a few caveats. Docker is more of a general purpose tool for building environments for running &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;, whether that be an apache webserver or a jabber messaging doohickey (whereas e.g. something like travis is basically a domain-specific language for creating and running automated tests). There were a few tricks I needed to employ to make the whole testing process smooth in both cases, which I&amp;rsquo;ll document here for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;You can &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; a set of files / directories to a docker environment inside your Dockerfile, but if you want your set of tests to pick up any changes made since the environment was created, you really should mount your testing directory inside the container using the &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you need to download/install a piece of software when building the docker container, use the &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; directive instead of &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;. This will speed up rebuilding the container while you&amp;rsquo;re iterating on it (because you can take advantage of the Docker layers cache).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;You almost certainly want to create a script (&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/python_moztelemetry/blob/d2aa84bbac09465d38eeb0b5beb20edc7ddcc21b/runtests.sh"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) to streamline all the steps of running the tests: this will make running the tests easier for anyone wanting to contribute to your project and reduce the amount of documentation that you will have to write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevant files and documentation are in the repositories linked above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Stockwell"&gt;Stockwell project&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking on ways to make it easier for developers to diagnose failure of our tests in automation. It&amp;rsquo;s often very difficult to reproduce an intermittent failure we see in Treeherder locally since the environment is so different, but historically it has been a big hassle to get access to the machines we use in automation for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option that rolled out last year was the so-called one-click loaner, which enabled developers to sign out an virtual machine instance identical to the ones used to run unit tests (at least if the tests are running on Taskcluster, which is increasingly often the case), then execute their particular case with whatever extra debugging options they would find useful. This is a big step forward, but it&amp;rsquo;s still quite a bit of hassle, since it requires a bunch of manual work on the part of the developer to interact with the instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; re-run the particular test an arbitrary number of times with whatever options we wanted, simply by clicking on a few buttons on Treeherder? I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring this for the first few months of 2017 and I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a prototype which I think is ready for people to start playing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user interface to this is pretty straightforward. Just find a job you want to retrigger in Treeherder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2017/04/treeherder-selected-mochitest.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then select the &amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; option in the panel below and press &amp;ldquo;Custom Action&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2017/04/treeherder-taskcluster-options.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should get a small piece of JSON to edit, which corresponds to the configuration for the retriggered job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2017/04/treeherder-custom-action.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main field to edit is &amp;ldquo;path&amp;rdquo;. You should set this to the name of the test you want to try retriggering. For example &lt;code&gt;dom/animation/test/css-transitions/test_animation-ready.html&lt;/code&gt;. You can also set custom Firefox preferences and environment variables, to turn on different types of debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately as usual with a new feature at Mozilla, there are a bunch of limitations and caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;This depends on functionality that&amp;rsquo;s only in Taskcluster, so  buildbot jobs are exempt.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;No support for Android yet. In combination with the above  limitation, this implies that this functionality only works  on Linux (at least until other platforms are moved to Taskcluster,  which hopefully isn&amp;rsquo;t that far off).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Browser chrome tests failing in mysterious ways if run repeatedly  (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1347654"&gt;bug 1347654&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Only reftest and mochitest are currently supported. XPCShell  support is blocked by the lack of support in its harness for  running a job repeatedly (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1347696"&gt;bug 1347696&lt;/a&gt;).  Web Platform Tests need the requisite support in mozharness for  just setting up the tests without running them &amp;mdash; the same issue  that prevents us from debugging such tests with a one-click loaner  (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348833"&gt;bug 1348833&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from fixing the above limitations, the following features would also be really nifty to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Ability to trigger a custom job as part of a try push (i.e.  not needing to retrigger off an existing job)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Run these jobs under rr, and provide a way to login and  interactively debug when the problem is actually reproduced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am actually in the process of moving to another team @ Mozilla (more on that in another post), so I probably won&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of time to work on the above &amp;mdash; but I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to help anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in developing this idea further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special shout out to the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/TaskCluster"&gt;Taskcluster&lt;/a&gt; team for helping me with the development of this feature: in particular the action task implementation from &lt;a href="https://jonasfj.dk/"&gt;Jonas Finnemann Jensen&lt;/a&gt; that made it possible to develop this feature in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;I just added a feature to Treeherder which lets you cancel a set of jobs (say, from a botched try push) much more easily. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that this will be helpful in keeping our resource usage on try more under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses the &amp;ldquo;pinboard&amp;rdquo; feature of Treeherder which very few people are familiar with, so I made a very short video tutorial on how to make use of this feature and put it on the Joy of Automation channel:&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Mozilla, we&amp;rsquo;ve accepted that a certain amount of intermittent failure in our automated testing of Firefox is to be expected. That is, for every push, a subset of the tests that we run will fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality (or lack thereof) of the push itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the main integration branches that developers commit code to, we have dedicated staff and volunteers called sheriffs who attempt to distinguish these expected failures from intermittents through a manual classification process using &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org"&gt;Treeherder&lt;/a&gt;. On any given push, you can usually find some failed jobs that have stars beside them, this is the work of the sheriffs, indicating that a job&amp;rsquo;s failure is &amp;ldquo;nothing to worry about&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2016/11/treeherder-in-action.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generally works pretty well, though unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help developers who need to test their changes on Try, which have the same sorts of failures but no sheriffs to watch them or interpret the results. For this reason (and a few others which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail on here), there&amp;rsquo;s been much interest in having Treeherder autoclassify known failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a partially implemented version that attempts to do this based on structured (failure line) information, but we&amp;rsquo;ve had some difficulty creating a reasonable user interface to train it. Sheriffs are used to being able to quickly tag many jobs with the same bug. Having to go through each job&amp;rsquo;s failure lines and manually annotate each of them is much more time consuming, at least with the approaches that have been tried so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2016/11/treeherder-per-line-classification.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite possible that this is a solvable problem, but I thought it might be an interesting exercise to see how far we could get training an autoclassifier with only the existing per-job classifications as training data. With some recent work I&amp;rsquo;ve done on refactoring Treeherder&amp;rsquo;s database, getting a complete set of per-job failure line information is only a small SQL query away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: sql"&gt;
 &lt;table class="sourcetable"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="linenos"&gt;
     &lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="code"&gt;
     &lt;div class="source"&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bug_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bug_job_map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text_log_step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;job_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;job_id&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text_log_error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;2016-10-31&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;created&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;2016-11-24&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bug_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bjm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;step_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to give some explanation of this query, the &amp;ldquo;bug_job_map&amp;rdquo; provides a list of bugs that have been applied to jobs. The &amp;ldquo;text_log_step&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;text_log_error&amp;rdquo; tables contain the actual errors that Treeherder has extracted from the textual logs (to explain the failure). From this raw list of mappings and errors, we can construct a data structure incorporating the job, the assigned bug and the textual errors inside it. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="brush: json"&gt;
 &lt;table class="sourcetable"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="linenos"&gt;
     &lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt; 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="code"&gt;
     &lt;div class="source"&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"bug_number"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1202623&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"lines"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"browser_private_clicktoplay.js Test timed out -"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"browser_private_clicktoplay.js Found a tab after previous test timed out: http:/&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;/browser/browser/base/content/test/plugins/plugin_test.html -"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"browser_private_clicktoplay.js Found a browser window after previous test timed out -"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"browser_privatebrowsing_newtab_from_popup.js Test timed out -"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s2"&gt;  after previous test timed out -"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quick google searching revealed that &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/"&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt; is a popular tool for experimenting with text classifications. They even had a &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on classifying newsgroup posts which seemed tantalizingly close to what we needed to do here. In that example, they wanted to predict which newsgroup a post belonged to based on its content. In our case, we want to predict which existing bug a job failure should belong to based on its error lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously some differences in our domain: test failures are much more regular and structured. There are lots of numbers in them which are mostly irrelevant to the classification (e.g. the &amp;ldquo;expected 12 pixels different, got 10!&amp;rdquo; type errors in reftests). Ordering of failures might matter. Still, some of the techniques used on corpora of normal text documents for training a classifier probably map nicely onto what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do here: it seems plausible that weighting words which occur more frequently less strongly against ones that are less common would be helpful, for example, and that&amp;rsquo;s one thing their default transformers does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I built up a small little script to download a subset of the downloaded data (from November 1st to November 23rd), used it as training data for a classifier, then tested that against another subset of test failures between November 24th and 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bugnum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;predicted_bugnum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_correct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"--&amp;gt; correct"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_missed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"--&amp;gt; missed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;)"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;predicted_bugnum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Correct: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; Missed: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; Ratio: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num_correct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_missed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_correct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num_correct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_missed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With absolutely no tweaking whatsoever, I got an accuracy rate of 75% on the test data. That is, the algorithm chose the correct classification given the failure text 1312 times out of 1959. Not bad for a first attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting that working, I did some initial testing to see if I could get better results by reusing some of the error ETL summary code in Treeherder we use for bug suggestions, but the results were pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s next? This seems like a wide open area to me, but some initial areas that seem worth exploring, if we wanted to take this idea further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Investigate cases where the autoclassification failed or had a near miss. Is there a pattern here? Is there something simple we could do, either by tweaking the input data or using a better vectorizer/tokenizer?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Have a confidence threshold for using the autoclassifier&amp;rsquo;s data. It seems likely to me that many of the cases above where we got the wrong were cases where the classifier itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t that confident in the result (vs. others). We can either present that in the user interface or avoid classifications for these cases altogether (and leave it up to a human being to make a decision on whether this is an intermittent).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Using the structured log data inside the database as input to a classifier. Structured log data here is much more regular and denser than the free text that we&amp;rsquo;re using. Even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly classified, we may well get better results by using it as our input data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to experiment with the data and/or code, I&amp;rsquo;ve put it up on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/wlach/treeherder-classifier"&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to talk about some recent performance improvements we&amp;rsquo;ve made recently to &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Treeherder"&gt;Treeherder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1311511"&gt;Bug 1311511&lt;/a&gt;: Changed the repository endpoint so we don&amp;rsquo;t do 40 redundant database  queries (this was generally innocuous, but could delay loading by  400ms if the database was under heavy load).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310016"&gt;Bug 1310016&lt;/a&gt;: Persisted database connections across requests (this  can save ~40&amp;ndash;50ms per request, of which there can be 5&amp;ndash;10  when loading a Treeherder page).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308782"&gt;Bug 1308782&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; download job type and group information  from the server to get a &amp;ldquo;sorting order&amp;rdquo; for the job lists. This was  never necessary, but it&amp;rsquo;s gotten exponentially more painful as  people have added job types to Treeherder (job type information is  now around a megabyte of JSON these days). This saves 5&amp;ndash;10 seconds on a  typical page load.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to come, but with these changes Treeherder should be faster for everyone to load. It should be particularly noticeable on try pushes, where the last item was by far the largest bottleneck. Here&amp;rsquo;s a youtube video of the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNJGoZhA4Vs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original is on the left. The newer, faster Treeherder is on the right. Pay particular attention to how much faster the job information populates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story? Optimization can be helpful, but it&amp;rsquo;s better if you can avoid doing the work altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every commit to Firefox, we run a battery of builds and automated tests on the resulting source tree to make sure that the result still works and meets our correctness and performance quality criteria. This is expensive: every new push to our repository implies hundreds of hours of machine time. However, automated quality control is essential to ensure that the product that we&amp;rsquo;re shipping to users is something that we can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about evaluating the quality of the product which does the building and testing? Who does that? And by what criteria would we say that our automation system is good or bad? Up to now, our procedures for this have been rather embarassingly adhoc. With some exceptions (such as &lt;a href="https://brasstacks.mozilla.com/orangefactor/"&gt;OrangeFactor&lt;/a&gt;), our QA process amounts to motivated engineers doing a one-off analysis of a particular piece of the system, filing a few bugs, then forgetting about it. Occasionally someone will propose turning build and test automation for a specific platform on or off in mozilla.dev.planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to suggest that the time has come to take a more systemic approach to this class of problem. We spend a lot of money on people and machines to maintain this infrastructure, and I think we need a more disciplined approach to make sure that we are getting good value for that investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I feel like we need to pay closer attention to the following characteristics of our automation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;End-to-end times from push submission to full completion of all  build and test jobs: if this gets too long, it makes the lives  of all sorts of people painful &amp;mdash; tree closures become longer when  they happen (because it takes longer to either notice bustage or  find out that it&amp;rsquo;s fixed), developers have to wait longer for  try pushes (making them more likely to just push directly to an  integration branch, causing the former problem&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Number of machine hours consumed by the different types of test  jobs: our resources are large (relatively speaking), but not  unlimited. We need proper accounting of where we&amp;rsquo;re spending money  and time. In some cases, resources used to perform a task that  we don&amp;rsquo;t care that much about could be redeployed towards an  underresourced task that we do care about. A good example of this  was linux32 talos (performance tests) last year: when the question  was raised of why we were doing performance testing on this specific  platform (in addition to Linux64), no one could come up with a great  justification. So we turned the tests off and reconfigured the machines  to do Windows performance tests (where we were suffering from a severe  lack of capacity).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been prototyping a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been calling &amp;ldquo;Infraherder&amp;rdquo; which uses the data inside &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org"&gt;Treeherder&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s job database to try to answer these questions (and maybe some others that I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought of yet). You can see a hacky version of it on &lt;a href="http://wlach.github.io/treeherder/ui/infra.html#/last-finished"&gt;my github fork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why implement this in Treeherder you might ask? Two reasons. First, Treeherder already stores the job data in a historical archive that&amp;rsquo;s easy to query (using SQL). Using this directly makes sense over creating a new data store. Second, Treeherder provides a useful set of front-end components with which to build a UI with which to visualize this information. I actually did my initial prototyping inside an ipython notebook, but it quickly became obvious that for my results to be useful to others at Mozilla we needed some kind of real dashboard that people could dig into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Treeherder team at Mozilla, we&amp;rsquo;ve found the &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; software to be invaluable for diagnosing and fixing quality and performance problems for Treeherder itself, so I took some inspiration from it (unfortunately the problem space of our automation is not quite the same as that of a web application, so we can&amp;rsquo;t just use New Relic directly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently two views in the prototype, a &amp;ldquo;last finished&amp;rdquo; view and a &amp;ldquo;total&amp;rdquo; view. I&amp;rsquo;ll describe each of them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="last-finished"&gt;Last finished&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view shows the counts of which scheduled automation jobs were the &amp;ldquo;last&amp;rdquo; to finish. The hypothesis is that jobs that are frequently last indicate blockers to developer productivity, as they are the &amp;ldquo;long pole&amp;rdquo; in being able to determine if a push is good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-last-finished.png" width="500px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away from this view, you can see the mochitest devtools 9 test is often the last to finish on try, with Windows 7 mochitest debug a close second. Assuming that the reasons for this are not resource starvation (they don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be), we could probably get results into the hands of developers and sheriffs faster if we split these jobs into two seperate ones. I filed bugs &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294489"&gt;1294489&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294706"&gt;1294706&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="total-time"&gt;Total Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view just shows which jobs are taking up the most machine hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2016/08/infraherder-total.png" width="500px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably unsurprisingly, it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s Android test jobs that are taking up most of the time here: these tests are running on multiple layers of emulation (AWS instances to emulate Linux hardware, then the already slow QEMU-based Android simulator) so are not expected to have fast runtime. I wonder if it might not be worth considering running these tests on faster instances and/or bare metal machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux32 debug tests seem to be another large consumer of resources. Market conditions make turning these tests off altogether a non-starter (see bug &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255890"&gt;1255890&lt;/a&gt;), but how much value do we really derive from running the debug version of linux32 through automation (given that we&amp;rsquo;re already doing the same for 64-bit Linux)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="request-for-comments"&gt;Request for comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SrlJQQ3qWuM0tvruG6Lr59t3hJ4XRUoMIrIRQYvwu9A/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;an RFC&lt;/a&gt; for this project on Google Docs, as a sort of test case for a new process we&amp;rsquo;re thinking of using in Engineering Productivity for these sorts of projects. If you have any questions or comments, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them! My perspective on this vast problem space is limited, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are things that I&amp;rsquo;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Following on the footsteps of Mike Ling&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="/blog/2015/09/perfherder-summer-of-contribution-thoughts/"&gt;amazing work&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ngineeringProductivity‎/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 (he&amp;rsquo;s gone on to do a GSOC project), I got two amazing contributors to continue working on the project for a few weeks this summer as part of our &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution"&gt;quarter of contribution&lt;/a&gt; program: Shruti Jasoria and Roy Chiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shruti started by adding a feature to the treeherder/perfherder backend (ability to enable or disable a new performance framework on a tentative basis), then went on to make all sorts of improvements to the Treeherder / Perfherder frontend, fixing bugs in the performance sheriffing frontend, updating code to use more modern standards (including a gigantic patch to enable a bunch of eslint rules and fix the corresponding problems).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy worked all over the codebase, starting with some simple frontend fixes to Treeherder, moving on to fix a large number of nits in Perfherder&amp;rsquo;s alerts view. My personal favorite is the fact that we now paginate the list of alerts inside this view, which makes navigation waaaaay back into history possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2016/08/perfherder-alert-pagination.png" alt="alert pagination" width="300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a summary of their work at these links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Shruti and Roy! You&amp;rsquo;ve helped to make sure Firefox (and Servo!) performance remains top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to announce that, once again, my team (&lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity"&gt;Mozilla Engineering Productivity&lt;/a&gt;) is just about to start running another &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution"&gt;quarter of contribution&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a great opportunity for newer community members to dive deep on some of the projects we&amp;rsquo;re working on, brush up on their programming and problem solving skills, and work with experienced mentors. You can find more information on this program &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Summer_2016"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found this program to be a really great experience on both sides &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for contributors to really go beyond the &amp;ldquo;good first bug&amp;rdquo; style of patches to having a really substantial impact on some of the projects that we&amp;rsquo;re working on while gaining lots of software development skills that are useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be mentoring one or two people on the Perfherder project, a tool we use to measure and sheriff Firefox performance. If you&amp;rsquo;re inclined to work on some really interesting data analysis and user interface problems in Python and JavaScript, please have a look at the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/Perfherder"&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; and get in touch. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically at Mozilla, we&amp;rsquo;ve had a bunch of different systems running to benchmark Firefox&amp;rsquo;s performance. The two most broadly-scoped are &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; (which runs as part of our build process, and emphasizes common real-world use cases, like page loading) and &lt;a href="https://arewefastyet.com/"&gt;Are We Fast Yet&lt;/a&gt; (which runs seperately, and emphasizes JavaScript performance and benchmarks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, most of my focus over the last year-and-a-bit has been developing a system called Perfherder, which aims to make monitoring and acting on performance data easier. A great introduction to Perfherder is my &lt;a href="/blog/2016/03/platform-engineering-project-of-the-month-perfherder/"&gt;project of the month post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial focus of Perfherder has been Talos, which is deeply integrated into our automation and also maintained by Engineering Productivity (my group). However, the intention was always to allow anyone in the Mozilla community to submit performance data for Firefox and sheriff it, much like Treeherder has supported the submission of test result data from third parties (e.g. autophone, Firefox UI tests). There are more commonalities than differences in how we do performance sheriffing with Are We Fast Yet (which currently has its own web interface) and Perfherder, so it made sense to see if we could pool resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, over the last couple of months, &lt;a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/"&gt;Joel Maher&lt;/a&gt; and I have been in discussions with Hannes Verschore, current maintainer of Are We Fast Yet (AWFY) to see what could be done. It looks like it is possible for Perfherder to provide most of what AWFY needs, though there are a few exceptions. I thought for the benefit of others, it might be useful to outline what&amp;rsquo;s done, what&amp;rsquo;s coming next, and what might not be implemented (at least not any time soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whats-done"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s done&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Get AWFY submitting data to Perfherder and allow it to be sheriffed  seperately from Talos. This is working on treeherder stage, and you  can already examine the &lt;a href="https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html#/alerts?status=0&amp;amp;framework=5"&gt;alert data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whats-in-progress-or-in-the-near-term-pipeline"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in progress (or in the near-term pipeline)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Allow custom alerting behaviour (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1254595"&gt;bug 1254595&lt;/a&gt;). For example, we want  to alert on subtests for AWFY while still summarizing the results.  This is something we don&amp;rsquo;t currently support.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Allow creating an alert manually (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260791"&gt;bug 1260791&lt;/a&gt;). Sadly, our regression detection  algorithm is not perfect. AWFY already supports this, we should too. This is something we also want for Talos.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Make regression-filing templates non-talos-specific (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260805"&gt;bug 1260805&lt;/a&gt;). Currently we have a convenience template for filing bugs for performance  regressions, but this is currently specific to various things about Talos (job running instructions, links to documentation, etc.). We should  make it configurable so other projects like AWFY can take advantage of this functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="under-consideration"&gt;Under consideration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Some kind of support for bisecting a push to figure out which patch  caused a regression. AWFY currently supports this, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly  difficult thing to add to Perfherder (much of which is built upon  Treeherder&amp;rsquo;s per-push result model). Maybe this is something we should  do, but it would be a significant amount of effort.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Proprietary benchmarks: AWFY runs one benchmark the results for  which we can&amp;rsquo;t make public. Adding &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; jobs or results to  Treeherder is likely a big can of worms, but it might be something  we want to do eventually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="probably-wont-fix"&gt;Probably won&amp;rsquo;t fix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Supporting comparative measurements between Firefox and other  browsers. This is an important task, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit into the  model of Perfherder, which is intimately tied to the revision data  associated with Firefox. To do this would require detailed tracking  of Chrome on the same basis, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s really a place  where we want to go. We should definitely monitor for general  trends, but I think that is best done with a seperate system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[ originally posted on &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/itdfru6csSk/vfVP_WDXBgAJ"&gt;mozilla.dev.platform&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello from Platform Engineering Operations! Once a month we highlight one of our projects to help the Mozilla community discover a useful tool or an interesting contribution opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month’s project is Perfherder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-perfherder"&gt;What is Perfherder?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfherder is a generic system for visualizing and analyzing performance data produced by the many automated tests we run here at Mozilla (such as Talos, &amp;ldquo;Are we fast yet?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Are we slim yet?&amp;rdquo;). The chief goal of the project is to make sure that performance of Firefox gets better, not worse over time. It does this by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Tracking the performance generated by our automated tests, allowing  them to be visualized on a graph.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Providing a sheriffing dashboard which allows for incoming  alerts of performance regressions to be annotated and triaged - bugs  can be filed based on a template and their resolution status can be  tracked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its own user interface, Perfherder also provides an API on the backend that other people can use to build custom performance visualizations and dashboards. For example, the metrics group has been working on a set of release quality indices for performance based on Perfherder data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/"&gt;https://metrics.mozilla.com/quality-indices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfherder is part of Treeherder, building on that project&amp;rsquo;s existing support for tracking revision and test job information. Like the rest of Treeherder, Perfherder&amp;rsquo;s backend is written in Python, using the Django web framework. The user interface is written as an AngularJS application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learning-more"&gt;Learning more&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on Perfherder than you ever wanted to know, please see the wiki page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-i-contribute"&gt;Can I contribute?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! We have had some fantastic contributions from the community to Perfherder, and are always looking for more. This is a great way to help developers make Firefox faster (or use less memory). The core of Perfherder is relatively small, so this is a great chance to learn either Django or Angular if you have a small amount of Python and/or JavaScript experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have set aside a set of bugs that are suitable for getting started here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;amp;resolution=---&amp;amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;amp;query_format=advanced&amp;amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug"&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=12722722&amp;amp;resolution=---&amp;amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;amp;query_format=advanced&amp;amp;status_whiteboard=perfherder-starter-bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on contributing to Perfherder, please see the contribution section of the above wiki page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a small thing, but I submitted a patch to &lt;a href="http://trychooser.pub.build.mozilla.org/"&gt;trychooser&lt;/a&gt; last week which adds a tooltip indicating the actual Talos tests that are run as part of the various jobs that you can schedule as part of a try push. It&amp;rsquo;s in production as of now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src="/files/2016/02/talos-trychooser.webm" controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the only way to do this was to dig into the actual buildbot code, which was more than a little annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think your patch might have a good chance of regressing performance, please do run the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests"&gt;Talos tests&lt;/a&gt; before you check in. It&amp;rsquo;s much less work for all of us when these things are caught before integration and back outs are no fun for anyone. We really need better documentation for this stuff, but meanwhile if you need help with this, please ask in the #perf channel on irc.mozilla.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;I was saddened to find out last week that the person who introduced me to Zen practice three years ago, Albert Low, has passed away. Albert was the teacher of the &lt;a href="http://www.zenmontreal.ca/"&gt;Montreal Zen Center&lt;/a&gt;, which I was a member of for a brief period (6 months) in 2014 before I moved to Toronto and started practicing at &lt;a href="http://torontozen.org/"&gt;the center&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert&amp;rsquo;s instruction was the gateway to a practice that has had a profound impact on my life. More than anything, he helped me understand Zen as something that one could incorporate directly into daily life. I will remain forever grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;As my blog goes to github pages, so do my other side projects. I just moved nixi, my bikestation finder project, to github pages. Its new location:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wlach.github.io/nixi"&gt;http://wlach.github.io/nixi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted not to move over the domain: it would have cost extra money, time and hassle and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify it for the very, very small number of people that still use this site (yes, there are a few, including myself!). For now, nixi.ca will redirect to the github pages site until I decommision my linode server, probably at the end of January (end of Feburary at the latest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transition brings some other changes with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Now using the &lt;a href="https://citybik.es"&gt;citybik.es&lt;/a&gt; API directly,  instead of proxing through an intermediary server. This was necessitated  by the switch to github pages, but I suspect this will be more reliable  than what we were doing before. Thanks citybik.es!&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Removed all analytics and facebook integration. As with the domain, it didn&amp;rsquo;t  seem worth bringing over. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to give people at least marginally  more privacy than they had before where possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think nixi is worlds more usable than most bikesharing maps, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not an actively maintained project of mine any more. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping it lasts many more years in its new incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking about doing it for longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit, I finally bit the bullet and decided to migrate away from WordPress, towards a markdown-based blog generator (&lt;a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/frog"&gt;Frog&lt;/a&gt; in this case). All the content from the old blog is coming with me (thanks mostly to WordPress&amp;rsquo;s jekyll exporter plugin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While WordPress is a pretty impressive piece of software, it isn&amp;rsquo;t the ideal platform for the sorts of things I want to express. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable tool for publishing straight longform essays, but my more interesting posts tend to also include images, code and examples, and sometimes &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/it-8217-s-all-about-the-entropy/"&gt;even math&lt;/a&gt;. Making those look reasonable involved a bunch of manual effort and the end result wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly great. I was particularly disappointed in its (lack of) support for inline code snippits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this set of problems is resolvable by installing the right set of plugins. Perhaps. But therein lies my second problem with WordPress: it&amp;rsquo;s big, complex piece of software written in PHP, and I&amp;rsquo;m frankly tired of figuring out how to (barely) make it do the things I need it to do, while half-worrying that the new fancy WPAwesome plugin I&amp;rsquo;m installing is malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly realizing the limits to what I have the time (and energy) to accomplish. While &amp;ldquo;Making WordPress do the things I want&amp;rdquo; is something I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; continue working on, it would come at the expense of other things that I find more rewarding, whether that be meditating, &lt;a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/"&gt;brushing up on deep learning&lt;/a&gt;, or even just writing more stuff here. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect this new blog to be maintenance free, but it should be an order of magnitude simpler using Frog, which is narrowly focused on my rather technical use case and specifically has great support for inline code, images, and math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, I&amp;rsquo;m completely tired of maintaining the Linux server that my blog ran on. Registering domains and setting up my own HTTP server seemed like an interesting diversion in 2009, when cheap Linux VPSes were first starting to appear on the market. These days&amp;hellip; well, not so much. It&amp;rsquo;s a minor, though not completely trivial, expense ($10 USD/mo.) but more importantly it&amp;rsquo;s a sink of my time to install security patches, make sure things are to up to date, etc. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m solving the same (boring) set of problems over and over, with no real payoff. Time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this blog (along with my other hosted projects, like &lt;a href="http://nixi.ca"&gt;NIXI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="meditation.wrla.ch"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;) will be moving to &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. Initially I had the worry that this move would mean that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;ldquo;in control of my own destiny&amp;rdquo;, but on reflection I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s true. The fact that my blog is basically a giant git repository should make switching hosting providers quite easy if Github becomes unsatisfactory for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even the custom domain (wrla.ch) seems unnecessary at this point. Although github pages does support them, I&amp;rsquo;m just not seeing the value in keeping it around. What purpose does it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; serve? All a custom personal domain really says to me is that the person had the time/money to register it. Is that something that someone in my position really needs to communicate? And if I don&amp;rsquo;t need it, why continue with the unnecessary expense and hassle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only legitimate reason to keep the domain would be continuity for readers (i.e. there&amp;rsquo;s a link or two in their browser history), but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a big deal in my case. Yes, people might occasionally be thrown off and have to use Yahoo/Google to re-find something&amp;hellip; but for the type of content I host, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that will take too much collective time. In the grand stream of things, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty small potatoes. Most of my traffic just comes through planet.mozilla.org, and that&amp;rsquo;s easy to redirect automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So though I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping around wrla.ch for a little bit to give people time to migrate their links (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t expire until the end of February 2016), it will also be going away. Please redirect your feed readers to &lt;a href="https://wlach.github.io"&gt;wlach.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto more interesting things!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2015/10/the-new-old-perfherder-data-model/"&gt;database refactoring&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned a few weeks ago, some cool stuff has been going into &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking installer size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfherder is now tracking the size of the Firefox installer for the various platforms we support (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149164"&gt;bug 1149164&lt;/a&gt;). I originally only intended to track Android .APK size (on request from the mobile team), but installer sizes for other platforms came along for the ride. I don&amp;#8217;t think anyone will complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-300x181.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-03 at 5.28.48 PM" width="300" height="181" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1274" srcset="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-300x181.png 300w, /files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.28.48-PM-1024x618.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?series=[mozilla-inbound,4eb0cde5431ee9aeb5eb14512ddb3da6d4702cf0,1]&amp;amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,80cac7ef44b76864458627c574af1a18a425f338,1]&amp;amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,0060252bdfb7632df5877b7594b4d16f1b5ca4c9,1]"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as exciting to me as the feature itself is how it&amp;#8217;s implemented: I added a log parser to treeherder which just picks up a line called &amp;#8220;PERFHERDER_DATA&amp;#8221; in the logs with specially formatted JSON data, and then automatically stores whatever metrics are in there in the database (platform, options, etc. are automatically determined). For example, on Linux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PERFHERDER_DATA: {"framework": {"name": "build_metrics"}, "suites": [{"subtests": [{"name": "libxul.so", "value": 99030741}], "name": "installer size", "value": 55555785}]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should make it super easy for people to add their own metrics to Perfherder for build and test jobs. We&amp;#8217;ll have to be somewhat careful about how we do this (we don&amp;#8217;t want to add thousands of new series with irrelevant / inconsistent data) but I think there&amp;#8217;s lots of potential here to be able to track things we care about on a per-commit basis. Maybe build times (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More compare view improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added filtering to the Perfherder compare view and added back links to the graphs view. Filtering should make it easier to highlight particular problematic tests in bug reports, etc. The graphs links shouldn&amp;#8217;t really be necessary, but unfortunately are due to the unreliability of our data &amp;#8212; sometimes you can only see if a particular difference between two revisions is worth paying attention to in the context of the numbers over the last several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.37.02-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.37.02-PM-300x157.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-03 at 5.37.02 PM" width="300" height="157" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1275" srcset="/files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.37.02-PM-300x157.png 300w, /files/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-03-at-5.37.02-PM-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the &lt;a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2015/09/perfherder-summer-of-contribution-thoughts/"&gt;summer of contribution&lt;/a&gt; has ended, Mike Ling continues to do great work. Looking at the commit log over the past few weeks, he&amp;#8217;s been responsible for the following fixes and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1218825"&gt;Bug 1218825&lt;/a&gt;: Can zoom in on perfherder graphs by selecting the main view&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1207309"&gt;Bug 1207309&lt;/a&gt;: Disable &amp;#8216;&amp;lt;&amp;rsquo; button in test chooser if no test selected&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1210503"&gt;Bug 1210503&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Include non-summary tests in main comparison view&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1153956"&gt;Bug 1153956&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Persist the selected revision in the url on perfherder (based on earlier work by Akhilesh Pillai)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal for this quarter is to create a fully functional interface for actually sheriffing performance regressions, to replace &lt;a href="http://alertmanager.allizom.org:8080/alerts.html"&gt;alertmanager&lt;/a&gt;. Work on this has been going well. More soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a good chunk of time last quarter redesigning how &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; stores its data internally. Here are some notes on this change, for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfherder&amp;#8217;s data model is based around two concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Series signatures: A unique set of properties (platform, test name, suite name, options) that identifies a performance test.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Series data: A set of measurements for a series signature, indexed by treeherder push and job information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was first written, Perfherder stored the second type of data as a JSON-encoded series in a relational (MySQL) database. That is, instead of storing each datum as a row in the database, we would store sequences of them. The assumption was that for the common case (getting a bunch of data to plot on a graph), this would be faster than fetching a bunch of rows and then encoding them as JSON. Unfortunately this wasn&amp;#8217;t really true, and it had some serious drawbacks besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the approach&amp;#8217;s performance was awful when it came time to add new data. To avoid needing to decode or download the full stored series when you wanted to render only a small subset of it, we stored the same series multiple times over various time intervals. For example, we stored the series data for one day, one week&amp;#8230; all the way up to one year. You can probably see the problem already: you have to decode and re-encode the same data structure many times for each time interval for every new performance datum you were inserting into the database. The pseudo code looked something like this for each push:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for each platform we're testing talos on:
  for each talos job for the platform:
    for each test suite in the talos job:
      for each subtest in the test suite:
        for each time interval in one year, 90 days, 60 days, ...:
           fetch and decode json series for that time interval from db
           add datapoint to end of series
           re-encode series as json and store in db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider that we have some 6 platforms (android, linux64, osx, winxp, win7, win8), 20ish test suites with potentially dozens of subtests&amp;#8230; and you can see where the problems begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being slow to write, this was also a pig in terms of disk space consumption. The overhead of JSON (&amp;#8220;{, }&amp;#8221; characters, object properties) really starts to add up when you&amp;#8217;re storing millions of performance measurements. We got around this (sort of) by gzipping the contents of these series, but that still left us with gigantic mysql replay logs as we stored the complete &amp;#8220;transaction&amp;#8221; of replacing each of these series rows thousands of times per day. At one point, we completely ran out of disk space on the treeherder staging instance due to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read performance was also often terrible for many common use cases. The original assumption I mentioned above was wrong: rendering points on a graph is only one use case a system like Perfherder has to handle. We also want to be able to get the set of series values associated with two result sets (to render comparison views) or to look up the data associated with a particular job. We were essentially indexing the performance data only on one single dimension (time) which made these other types of operations unnecessarily complex and slow &amp;#8212; especially as the data you want to look up ages. For example, to look up a two week old comparison between two pushes, you&amp;#8217;d also have to fetch the data for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; subsequent push. That&amp;#8217;s a lot of unnecessary overhead when you&amp;#8217;re rendering a comparison view with 100 or so different performance tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-08-07 at 1.57.39 PM" width="300" height="178" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1229" srcset="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png 300w, /files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the alternative? It&amp;#8217;s actually the most obvious thing: just encode one database row per performance series value and create indexes on each of the properties that we might want to search on (repository, timestamp, job id, push id). Yes, this is a lot of rows (the new database stands at 48 million rows of performance data, and counting) but you know what? MySQL is &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to handle that sort of load. The current performance data table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+----------------+------------------+
| Field          | Type             |
+----------------+------------------+
| id             | int(11)          |
| job_id         | int(10) unsigned |
| result_set_id  | int(10) unsigned |
| value          | double           |
| push_timestamp | datetime(6)      |
| repository_id  | int(11)          | 
| signature_id   | int(11)          | 
+----------------+------------------+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL can store each of these structures very efficiently, I haven&amp;#8217;t done the exact calculations, but this is well under 50 bytes per row. Including indexes, the complete set of performance data going back to last year clocks in at 15 gigs. Not bad. And we can examine this data structure across any combination of dimensions we like (push, job, timestamp, repository) making common queries to perfherder very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the initial assumption, that it would be faster to get a series out of the database if it&amp;#8217;s already pre-encoded? Nope, not really. If you have a good index and you&amp;#8217;re only fetching the data you need, the overhead of encoding a bunch of database rows to JSON is pretty minor. From my (remote) location in Toronto, I can fetch 30 days of &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/graphs?timerange=2592000&amp;amp;#038;series=[mozilla-inbound,c233ba1133abbd544002dfbc29d9e63ced42a20e,1]"&gt;tcheck2 data&lt;/a&gt; in 250 ms. Almost certainly most of that is network latency. If the original implementation was faster, it&amp;#8217;s not by a significant amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-300x188.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-10-23 at 1.55.09 PM" width="300" height="188" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1259" srcset="/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-300x188.png 300w, /files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-23-at-1.55.09-PM-1024x643.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes using ancient technologies (SQL) in the most obvious way is the right thing to do. &lt;a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html"&gt;DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Joel Maher &lt;a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/a-team-contribution-opportunity-dashboard-hacker/"&gt;announced the Perfherder summer of contribution&lt;/a&gt;. We wrapped things up there a few weeks ago, so I guess it&amp;#8217;s about time I wrote up a bit about how things went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the idea of summer of contribution was to give a set of contributors the opportunity to make a substantial contribution to a project we were working on (in this case, the &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; performance sheriffing system). We would ask that they sign up to do 5&amp;ndash;10 hours of work a week for at least 8 weeks. In return, Joel and myself would make ourselves available as mentors to answer questions about the project whenever they ran into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get things rolling, I split off a bunch of work that we felt would be reasonable to do by a contributor into bugs of varying difficulty levels (assigning them the bugzilla whiteboard tag &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=%20ateam-summer-of-contribution&amp;amp;#038;keywords_type=allwords&amp;amp;#038;list_id=12578272&amp;amp;#038;resolution=---&amp;amp;#038;resolution=FIXED&amp;amp;#038;resolution=INVALID&amp;amp;#038;resolution=WONTFIX&amp;amp;#038;resolution=DUPLICATE&amp;amp;#038;resolution=WORKSFORME&amp;amp;#038;resolution=INCOMPLETE&amp;amp;#038;resolution=SUPPORT&amp;amp;#038;resolution=EXPIRED&amp;amp;#038;resolution=MOVED&amp;amp;#038;query_format=advanced&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=NEW&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;amp;#038;bug_status=CLOSED"&gt;ateam-summer-of-contribution&lt;/a&gt;). When someone first expressed interest in working on the project, I&amp;#8217;d assign them a relatively easy front end one, just to cover the basics of working with the project (checking out code, making a change, submitting a PR to github). If they made it through that, I&amp;#8217;d go on to assign them slightly harder or more complex tasks which dealt with other parts of the codebase, the nature of which depended on what they wanted to learn more about. Perfherder essentially has two components: a data storage and analysis backend written in Python and Django, and a web-based frontend written in JS and Angular. There was (still is) lots to do on both, which gave contributors lots of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system worked pretty well for attracting people. I think we got at least 5 people interested and contributing useful patches within the first couple of weeks. In general I think onboarding went well. Having good documentation for Perfherder / Treeherder on the wiki certainly helped. We had lots of the usual problems getting people familiar with git and submitting proper pull requests: we use a somewhat clumsy combination of bugzilla and github to manage treeherder issues (we &amp;#8220;attach&amp;#8221; PRs to bugs as plaintext), which can be a bit offputting to newcomers. But once they got past these issues, things went relatively smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks in, I set up a fortnightly skype call for people to join and update status and ask questions. This proved to be quite useful: it let me and Joel articulate the higher-level vision for the project to people (which can be difficult to summarize in text) but more importantly it was also a great opportunity for people to ask questions and raise concerns about the project in a free-form, high-bandwidth environment. In general I&amp;#8217;m not a big fan of meetings (especially status report meetings) but I think these were pretty useful. Being able to hear someone else&amp;#8217;s voice definitely goes a long way to establishing trust that you just can&amp;#8217;t get in the same way over email and irc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our biggest challenge was retention. Due to (understandable) time commitments and constraints only one person (Mike Ling) was really able to stick with it until the end. Still, I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with that success rate: if you stop and think about it, even a 10-hour a week time investment is a fair bit to ask. Some of the people who didn&amp;#8217;t quite make it were quite awesome, I hope they come back some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, a special thanks to Mike Ling for sticking with us this long (he&amp;#8217;s still around and doing useful things long after the program ended). He&amp;#8217;s done &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/treeherder/commits/master?author=MikeLing"&gt;some really fantastic work&lt;/a&gt; inside Perfherder and the project is much better for it. I think my two favorite features that he wrote up are the improved test chooser which I talked about a few months ago and a &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1134780"&gt;get related platform / branch&lt;/a&gt; feature which is a big time saver when trying to determine when a performance regression was first introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the time to do a short email interview with him last week. Here&amp;#8217;s what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Tell us a little bit about yourself. Where do you live? What is it you do when not contributing to Perfherder?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a postgraduate student of NanChang HangKong university in China whose major is Internet of things. Actually,there are a lot of things I would like to do when I am AFK, play basketball, video game, reading books and listening music, just name it ; )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;How did you find out about the ateam summer of contribution program?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;well, I remember when I still a new comer of treeherder, I totally don&amp;#8217;t know how to start my contribution. So, I just go to treeherder irc and ask for advice. As I recall, emorley and jfrench talk with me and give me a lot of hits. Then Will (wlach) send me an Email about ateam summer of contribution and perfherder. He told me it&amp;#8217;s a good opportunity to learn more about treeherder and how to work like a team! I almost jump out of bed (I receive that email just before get asleep) and reply with YES. Thank you Will!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What did you find most challenging in the summer of contribution?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the most challenging thing is I not only need to know how to code but also need to know how treeherder actually work. It&amp;#8217;s a awesome project and there are a ton of things I haven&amp;#8217;t heard before (i.e T-test, regression). So I still have a long way to go before I familiar with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What advice would give you to future ateam contributors?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only thing you need to do is bring your question to irc and ask. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you need it! All the people in here are nice and willing to help. Enjoy it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my last update, we&amp;#8217;ve been trucking along with improvements to &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt;, the project for making Firefox performance sheriffing and analysis easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare visualization improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been spending quite a bit of time trying to fix up the display of information in the compare view, to address feedback from developers and hopefully generally streamline things. &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/vdjeric/"&gt;Vladan&lt;/a&gt; (from the perf team) referred me to &lt;a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/bwinton/"&gt;Blake Winton&lt;/a&gt;, who provided tons of awesome suggestions on how to present things more concisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an old versus new picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM-300x206.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 3.53.20 PM" width="300" height="206" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1218" srcset="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM-300x206.png 300w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-08-07 at 1.57.39 PM" width="300" height="178" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1229" srcset="/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM-300x178.png 300w, /files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-07-at-1.57.39-PM.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary of significant changes in this view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Removed or consolidated several types of numerical information which were overwhelming or confusing (e.g. presenting both numerical and percentage standard deviation in their own columns).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Added tooltips all over the place to explain what&amp;#8217;s being displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Highlight more strongly when it appears there aren&amp;#8217;t enough runs to make a definitive determination on whether there was a regression or improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Improve display of visual indicator of magnitude of regression/improvement (providing a pseudo-scale showing where the change ranges from 0% &amp;#8211; 20%+).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Provide more detail on the two changesets being compared in the header and make it easier to retrigger them (thanks to Mike Ling).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Much better and more intuitive error handling when something goes wrong (also thanks to Mike Ling).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of these changes isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily to make everything &amp;#8220;immediately obvious&amp;#8221; to people. We&amp;#8217;re not building general purpose software here: Perfherder will always be a rather specialized tool which presumes significant domain knowledge on the part of the people using it. However, even for our audience, it turns out that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of room to improve how our presentation: reducing the amount of extraneous noise helps people zero in on the things they really need to care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to everyone who took time out of their schedules to provide so much good feedback, in particular &lt;a href="http://avih.github.io/"&gt;Avi Halmachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://glandium.org/blog/"&gt;Glandium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://elvis314.wordpress.com/"&gt;Joel Maher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course more suggestions are always welcome. Please &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/comparechooser"&gt;give it a try&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Tree%20Management&amp;amp;#038;component=Perfherder"&gt;file bugs against the perfherder component&lt;/a&gt; if you find anything you&amp;#8217;d like to see changed or improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the word out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try pushes incorporating Talos jobs now automatically link to perfherder&amp;#8217;s compare view, both in the output from mercurial and in the emails the system sends. One of the challenges we&amp;#8217;ve been facing up to this point is just letting developers know that Perfherder &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; and it can help them either avoid or resolve performance regressions. I believe this will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data quality and ingestion improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple weeks, we&amp;#8217;ve been comparing our regression detection code when run against Graphserver data to Perfherder data. In doing so, we discovered that we&amp;#8217;ve sometimes been using the wrong algorithm (geometric mean) to summarize some of our tests, leading to unexpected and less meaningful results. For example, the v8_7 benchmark uses a custom weighting algorithm for its score, to account for the fact that the things it tests have a particular range of expected values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hopefully prevent this from happening again in the future, we&amp;#8217;ve decided to move the test summarization code out of Perfherder back into Talos (&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1184966"&gt;bug 1184966&lt;/a&gt;). This has the additional benefit of creating a stronger connection between the content of the Talos logs and what Perfherder displays in its comparison and graph views, which has thrown people off in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing data challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having better tools for visualizing this stuff is great, but it also highlights some continuing problems we&amp;#8217;ve had with data quality. It turns out that our automation setup often produces &lt;em&gt;qualitatively different&lt;/em&gt; performance results for the exact same set of data, depending on when and how the tests are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of random noise is always expected when running performance tests. As much as we might try to make them uniform, our testing machines and environments are just not 100% identical. That we expect and can deal with: our standard approach is just to retrigger runs, to make sure we get a representative sample of data from our population of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem comes when there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;em&gt;pattern&lt;/em&gt; to the noise: we&amp;#8217;ve already noticed that tests run on the weekends produce different results (see Joel&amp;#8217;s post from a year ago, &lt;a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/a-case-of-the-weekends/"&gt;&amp;#8220;A case of the weekends&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;) but it seems as if there&amp;#8217;s other circumstances where one set of results will be different from another, depending on the time that each set of tests was run. Some tests and platforms (e.g. the a11yr suite, MacOS X 10.10) seem particularly susceptible to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find better ways of dealing with this problem, as it can result in a lot of wasted time and energy, for both sheriffs and developers. See for example &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1190877"&gt;bug 1190877&lt;/a&gt;, which concerned a completely spurious regression on the tresize benchmark that was initially blamed on some changes to the media code&amp;#8211; in this case, Joel speculates that the linux64 test machines we use might have changed from under us in some way, but we really don&amp;#8217;t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see two approaches possible here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Figure out what&amp;#8217;s causing the same machines to produce qualitatively different result distributions and address that. This is of course the ideal solution, but it requires coordination with other parts of the organization who are likely quite busy and might be hard.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Figure out better ways of detecting and managing these sorts of case. I have noticed that the standard deviation inside the results when we have spurious regressions/improvements tends to be higher (see for example &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/compare?originalProject=mozilla-inbound&amp;amp;#038;originalRevision=4d0818791d07&amp;amp;#038;newProject=mozilla-inbound&amp;amp;#038;newRevision=5e130ad70aa7"&gt;this compare view&lt;/a&gt; for the aforementioned &amp;#8220;regression&amp;#8221;). Knowing what we do, maybe there&amp;#8217;s some statistical methods we can use to detect bad data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;#8217;m leaning towards (2). I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ll ever completely solve this problem and I think coming up with better approaches to understanding and managing it will pay the largest dividends. Open to other opinions of course!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</content></entry>

  <content type="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;#8217;t been doing enough blogging about &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; (our project to make Talos and other per-checkin performance data more useful) recently. Let&amp;#8217;s fix that. We&amp;#8217;ve been making some good progress, helped in part by a group of new contributors that joined us through an experimental &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/please-welcome-the-dashboard-hacker-team/"&gt;summer of contribution&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Compare Talos, we&amp;#8217;ve designed something similar which hooks into the perfherder backend. This has already gotten some interest: see this post on &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.tree-management/IUmMuY8b52A/Asne1cW0I8EJ"&gt;dev.tree-management&lt;/a&gt; and this one on &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/PaJFBtvc3Vg/BvX-pFlsAkoJ"&gt;dev.platform&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re working towards building something that will be really useful both for (1) illustrating that the performance regressions we detect are real and (2) helping developers figure out the impact of their changes before they land them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.54.57-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.54.57-PM-300x207.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 3.54.57 PM" width="300" height="207" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1219" srcset="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.54.57-PM-300x207.png 300w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.54.57-PM.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM-300x206.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 3.53.20 PM" width="300" height="206" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1218" srcset="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM-300x206.png 300w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-3.53.20-PM.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the initial work was done by &lt;a href="https://elvis314.wordpress.com/"&gt;Joel Maher&lt;/a&gt; with lots of review for aesthetics and correctness by me. Avi Halmachi from the Performance Team also helped out with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"&gt;t-test&lt;/a&gt; model for detecting the confidence that we have that a difference in performance was real. Lately myself and &lt;a href="https://github.com/MikeLing"&gt;Mike Ling&lt;/a&gt; (one of our summer of contribution members) have been working on further improving the interface for usability &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m hopeful that we&amp;#8217;ll soon have something implemented that&amp;#8217;s broadly usable and comprehensible to the Mozilla Firefox and Platform developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphs improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#8217;s received slightly less attention lately than the comparison view above, we&amp;#8217;ve been making steady progress on the graphs view of performance series. Aside from demonstrations and presentations, the primary use case for this is being able to detect visually sustained changes in the result distribution for talos tests, which is often necessary to be able to confirm regressions. Notable recent changes include a much easier way of selecting tests to add to the graph from Mike Ling and more readable/parseable urls from &lt;a href="https://github.com/akhileshpillai"&gt;Akhilesh Pillai&lt;/a&gt; (another summer of contribution participant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.09.45-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.09.45-PM-300x174.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 4.09.45 PM" width="300" height="174" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1221" srcset="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.09.45-PM-300x174.png 300w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.09.45-PM-1024x595.png 1024w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.09.45-PM.png 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance alerts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been steadily working on making Perfherder generate alerts when there is a significant discontinuity in the performance numbers, similar to what &lt;a href="http://graphs.mozilla.org"&gt;GraphServer&lt;/a&gt; does now. Currently we have an option to generate a static CSV file of these alerts, but the eventual plan is to insert these things into a peristent database. After that&amp;#8217;s done, we can actually work on creating a UI inside Perfherder to replace &lt;a href="http://alertmanager.allizom.org:8080/alerts.html#"&gt;alertmanager&lt;/a&gt; (which currently uses GraphServer data) and start using this thing to sheriff performance regressions &amp;#8212; putting the herder into perfherder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this, I&amp;#8217;ve converted the graphserver alert generation code into a standalone python library, which has already proven useful as a component in the &lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/performance-testing-firefox-os-with-raptor/"&gt;Raptor project for FirefoxOS&lt;/a&gt;. Yay modularity and reusability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been working on creating and improving a &lt;a href="http://treeherder.readthedocs.org/retrieving_data.html#python-client"&gt;python API&lt;/a&gt; to access Treeherder data, which includes Perfherder. This lets you do interesting things, like dynamically run various types of statistical analysis on the data stored in the production instance of Perfherder (no need to ask me for a database dump or other credentials). I&amp;#8217;ve been using this to perform validation of the data we&amp;#8217;re storing and debug various tricky problems. For example, &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1182282"&gt;I found out last week that we were storing up to duplicate 200 entries in each performance series due to double data ingestion&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use this API to dynamically create interesting graphs and visualizations using &lt;a href="http://wrla.ch/blog/2014/04/pycon-2014-impressions-ipython-notebook-is-the-future-more/"&gt;ipython notebook&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;#8217;s a simple example of me plotting the last 7 days of youtube.com pageload data inline in a notebook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.43.55-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.43.55-PM-300x224.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-14 at 4.43.55 PM" width="300" height="224" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1224" srcset="/files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.43.55-PM-300x224.png 300w, /files/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-4.43.55-PM.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
