&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s kind of rare for me to pimp out products and services on my blog, but I&amp;#8217;m going to do so just this once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really despise faxes, but occasionally I do have to send them in the course of some of the admin work I still do on the side for my old consulting company (address changes, etc.). If you&amp;#8217;re in a similar boat, you really owe it to yourself to check out &lt;a href="http://hellofax.com"&gt;hellofax.com&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s about three gazillion times better than any other similar service that I&amp;#8217;ve tried (which were all embarassingly bad: I&amp;#8217;d sooner just go to a copy shop) and has saved me hours and hours of time and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
