&lt;p&gt;Build times for mozilla-central are a major factor in developer productivity. Faster build times mean more people using try (reducing breakage) and more fine-grained regression ranges (reducing the impact of breakages). As a side benefit, it allows us to avoid buying and maintaining more hardware (or put new hardware to better use). About a half-year ago, we set up a project called BuildFaster to try to bring these times down, setting the ambitious goal of getting build times (from checkin to tests done) down to 2 hours. We didn&amp;#8217;t quite succeed, though we did make some major strides. As part of this project, we also developed a dashboard to track our progress and narrow down the major bottlenecks which were keeping up our build times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this dashboard went down earlier this year with the rest of Brasstacks and we hadn&amp;#8217;t had the chance to bring it back up. I&amp;#8217;m pleased to announce that thanks to Jonathan Griffin, it&amp;#8217;s finally &lt;a href="http://brasstacks.mozilla.com/gofaster/#/"&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one is actively working on build performance at the moment (at least to my knowledge), it&amp;#8217;s still useful to keep track of build times to make sure that we don&amp;#8217;t regress. Anecdotally, it has seemed to me that the time needed to get results from try has been pretty stable over the last while, and this is borne out by the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the cliche goes: no news is good news.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
