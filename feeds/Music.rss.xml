&lt;p&gt;This weekend my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s band (Rice &amp;#38; Barley) did a show at Casa del Popolo. It was great, you should have been there. I made some videos using my trusty new iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.raespoon.com/"&gt;Rae Spoon&lt;/a&gt;, the headline act, was awesome. I recorded one of his songs, which he kindly gave permission to post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidya (the other opening band) was good too, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to record them. Next time!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
