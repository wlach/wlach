&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to give a quick update on some things that have been happening with the &lt;a href="https://www.metricsgraphics.org"&gt;metrics graphics&lt;/a&gt; since I stepped up to help with maintainership a few months ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hamilton"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s back as co-maintainer! This has been especially helpful  as he understands much of the historical context of metricsgraphics better than I do.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve merged in a large number of small fixes and improvements into the codebase,  thanks to myself and a number of other contributors. Special shout-out to Thomas  Champagne, who has contributed a &lt;a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics/commits?author=thomaschampagne"&gt;large number of nifty new features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We moved the project from Mozilla to its &lt;a href="https://github.com/metricsgraphics/"&gt;own organization&lt;/a&gt; on  github. This feels like a much better way forward for a project which is supposed to be useful  far outside the bounds of Mozilla, and hopeful makes contributors feel more like the first-class  citizens of the project that they actually are.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;We have a GSOC intern! As part of the Mozilla GSOC, Yunhao Zheng is going to be working on  adding rich brushing/zooming support to Metrics Graphics, which should be quite useful for  visualizing complex data in projects like &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity/Projects/Perfherder"&gt;Perfherder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KIOJtemqlCBktDdfdjDuS4XhICeaKO3QhNRwbnnf-g/"&gt;Project outline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5422620527296512"&gt;Yunhao&amp;rsquo;s proposal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
